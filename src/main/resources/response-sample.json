      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2> Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2 is virtually identical to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1334\" href=\"/super-mario-world/3030-1334/\" slug=\"super-mario-world\">  Super Mario World</a>, released originally on the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-9\" href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" slug=\"snes\"> SNES</a> in 1991. Some of the minor differences in this Game Boy Advance version are the ability to slightly move the camera and the additional noises that <a data-ref-id=\"3005-177\" href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" slug=\"mario\"> Mario</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-370\" href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" slug=\"luigi\"> Luigi</a> make (some lifted from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2931\" href=\"/super-mario-64/3030-2931/\" slug=\"super-mario-64\"> Super Mario 64</a>.) Yoshi coins are also included in every level, whereas they appear infrequently in Super Mario World. The GBA release makes it possible to save at any checkpoint or level completion. The multiplayer is a remake of the original <a data-ref-id=\"3030-19726\" href=\"/mario-bros/3030-19726/\" slug=\"mario-bros\">  Mario Bros.</a> and supports single-pak play. Brilliantly, other titles in the Super Mario Advance series are able to be used in multi-pak play. Some design concessions are made due to the limitations of the hardware in comparison to the SNES. The visuals are downgraded slightly to preserve high framerate and memory on the cartridge, and the button layout is altered to fit the GBA's simpler controls.",

Wario put's an evil spell over Mario Land, making the inhabitants think that <a data-ref-id=\"3015-689\" href=\"/evil-twin/3015-689/\" slug=\"evil-twin\">Wario is their leader</a>. He then seals the door of Mario's castle and takes the six golden coins that hold it shut and scatters them across the land. The objective of the game is to get all six coins and enter the castle to <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3027\" href=\"/duel/3015-3027/\" slug=\"duel\">confront Wario</a>.</p><p style=\"\">This is the first game in Nintendo history to feature Wario, that lout.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">The game generally plays like any Mario platformer would, with some interesting exceptions. Mario proceeds from left to right in his search for the exit to the next stage. Once he reaches this exit, he will discover a bell hanging above it. To reach this bell usually takes some extra effort, but if he manages to ring it he will be taken to a mini-game where he can earn powerups and extra lives, assuming he doesn't accidentally walk off the screen before he's awarded the prize.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3725/261321-flying_bunnies.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-261321\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3725/261321-flying_bunnies.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-261321\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3725/261321-flying_bunnies.png\"></a><figcaption>Bunny Mario, we hardly knew ye. Note kill counter and coin counter that exceeds 99 coins.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">New to the Mario series, and never seen again afterward, is Bunny Mario. After eating a Super Carrot, Mario transforms into Bunny Mario and can glide by twitching his ears up and down. Bunny Mario cannot fly technically, he can only <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3305\" href=\"/limited-flight-capability/3015-3305/\" slug=\"limited-flight-capability\">slow his descent</a> as Bunny Mario, similar to the glide effect given by the racoon and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-38\" href=\"/tanooki-suit/3055-38/\" slug=\"tanooki-suit\">tanooki</a> suits in other SMB games. Why this change was never later used is unknown, but at least you get to ponder how rabbit ears could possibly help Mario take to the skies.</p><p style=\"\">Mario selects worlds from a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-611\" href=\"/world-map/3015-611/\" slug=\"world-map\">map</a>, taking each world on in any order. The map has six different zones, each with 3-4 levels in them. There's the Tree Zone, Space Zone, Macro Zone, Pumpkin Zone, Mario Zone and Turtle Zone.</p><p style=\"\">In an interesting change, instead of a 100 coin counter, the coin counter goes up to 999, and doesn't roll over to zero or give you extra lives. The coins are used in a special zone where you play a game of chance to try to win awards, including fire flowers, bunny ears, extra lives, recovered coins, and a booby prize in the form of a witch, who gives you nothing. it is also possible to accidentally pick up more witches in certain areas, and these witches will be added to the minigame board, increasing the chance that you'll get nothing for the coins you risked.</p><p style=\"\">There is another counter, which goes up to 99, but this is a KILL counter, and when THAT reaches 100 kills, you are awarded with an invincibility star no matter where you are in the stage. This can potentially lead to more extra lives if you can kill enough enemies in combination before the invincibility runs out, and because it can occur anywhere on the stage, it can suddenly be very helpful in getting past certain areas (or it can be all but useless, depending on your timing).</p><p style=\"\">Another interesting fact is that this game is one of the few Mario games to feature a multi-stage boss that takes a total of more than 3 hits. In a sense, it's a combination of 3 successive bosses that total 9 hits, creating a bit of tension when you realize that you have a ways to go before you win.</p><h2>Zone Overview</h2><p style=\"\"><b>Turtle Zone</b> - Consists of three water themed levels. When Mario first enters the zone he gets swallowed by a giant turtle. The boss at the end of the zone is an <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3117\" href=\"/octopus/3015-3117/\" slug=\"octopus\">octopus</a>.</p><p style=\"\"><b>Mario Zone</b> - The zone looks like a giant toy Mario. Its four levels have a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2567\" href=\"/toy-box-stage/3015-2567/\" slug=\"toy-box-stage\">toy theme</a> to them. The bosses at the end of the zone are The Three Little Pigs.</p><p style=\"\"><b>Pumpkin Zone</b> - All four of the levels feature a scary theme. The zone looks like a giant <a data-ref-id=\"3055-2734\" href=\"/pumpkin/3055-2734/\" slug=\"pumpkin\">pumpkin</a>. The boss at the end of the zone is a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-707\" href=\"/witch/3015-707/\" slug=\"witch\">witch</a>.</p><p style=\"\"><b>Space Zone</b> - This zone consists of three <a data-ref-id=\"3035-50\" href=\"/space/3035-50/\" slug=\"space\">space</a> themed levels. To get to this zone you must first beat a level that looks like a giant <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2338\" href=\"/hippopotamus/3015-2338/\" slug=\"hippopotamus\">hippo</a> on the map screen. In these levels, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1601\" href=\"/gravity/3015-1601/\" slug=\"gravity\">gravity</a> is much lighter and Mario's jumps take him much farther. He also wears a space suit in all of the levels. The boss at the end of the zone is the alien <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2777\" href=\"/tatanga/3005-2777/\" slug=\"tatanga\">Tatanga</a>, the final boss from the first Mario Land game.</p><p style=\"\"><b>Macro Zone</b> - For this zone Mario shrinks to a small size while he enters a normal house. It consists of four levels. The boss at the end of the zone is a giant rat.</p><p style=\"\"><b>Tree Zone</b> - This zone consists of four levels set in a gigantic <a data-ref-id=\"3055-643\" href=\"/tree/3055-643/\" slug=\"tree\">tree</a>. All the levels are tree based on different parts of the tree. The boss at the end of the zone is a crow.</p><p style=\"\"><b>Final Zone</b> - This zone takes place inside Mario's Castle which has been warped to suit Wario's needs. The boss at the end of the zone is Wario himself who must be defeated three times. The first time he attacks he runs back and forth across the screen and slams into the ground dropping a light from the ceiling to try and hit you. After three hits, he escapes off screen. He then attacks as Bunny Wario. In this form, he leaps to the top of the screen and flys back and forth while slowly descending before slamming into the ground dropping the light and freezing you in place for a second or two. After another three hits he escapes one final time. He then transforms into Fire Wario. He attacks by running back and forth and shooting fireballs at you. After the final three hits he turns into Baby Wario and is defeated.</p><h2>3DS Version</h2><p style=\"\">It was announced for a Q4 2011 release on the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-138\" href=\"/3dsware/3045-138/\" slug=\"3dsware\">3DS</a> Virtual Console.</p>",

You only start off with 5 charcters, but the total amount is 21. As well as charcters, you can also unlock basket balls which have varying special appearences such as the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-588\" href=\"/yoshi-egg/3055-588/\" slug=\"yoshi-egg\">yoshi egg</a>. You get these for completing challenges and tournaments.<br/><br/><h3>Setup</h3>Each team consists of three players. One in left, right, and center. There are a few different types of characters to choose from, big characters such as Bowser and Donkey Kong are strong (they can make shields to block opponents quickly) but slow. Speedy characters like Diddy Kong are the fastest players. Technical charters are brilliant shooters, with a much higher percentage of making a shot shot. Tricky charters can do a trick to get past shields. You can have any range of types of characters in your team but the best is a mixture. <br/><br/><h3>Modes</h3><br/><b>Tourney </b>- A tournament mode. Playing through tournaments is an importiant method of unlocking different characters and items.<br/><br/><b>Exhibition</b> - The game's freeplay mode, choose whatever team and whatever opponents you like.<br/><br/><b>Matchup</b> - The multiplayer mode. <br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4344/193462-ntr_mariohoops_ss04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-193462\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4344/193462-ntr_mariohoops_ss04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-193462\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4344/193462-ntr_mariohoops_ss04.jpg\"></a><figcaption>In Mario sports, use of fire is a-okay.</figcaption></figure><b>Challenges</b> - This is the game's practice mode, you are given tasks like performing special shots or evading an opponent and then have to complete them. Finishing challenges is another way to unlock things. This also contains \"Dribble Race,\" a short time-trial race where your goal is to collect 100 <a data-ref-id=\"3055-219\" href=\"/coin/3055-219/\" slug=\"coin\">coins</a> on a course in the fastest time posible. <br/><br/><h3>Scoring</h3>You score 20 points for scoring a basket, and 30 if your past the 3 point line. Additionally you get 1 point added on for every coin you have (red coins are worth 10) making the game a bit strategic. You can have a maximum of 100 coins when you score a basket, although they can be taken away with green shells and other items. Another way to score points is by doing a special shot, to do one you have to tap out a pattern on the touch screen, each character's special looks different but some of the patterns are the same. Scoring a special shot gets you 40 points but it takes a short while to tap out the pattern so you have to have space or you'll be tackled.<br/><br/><h3>Courts</h3>There are a total of 16 courts in the game, each tourney has 4. You'll start off with 4 courts but when you complete that you will unlock another 3 for a different tourney, the three remaining maps in each court have to be unlocked by completing certain challenges. Although the courts are the same shape each one has its own hazards, for instance the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1670\" href=\"/pirate-ship/3035-1670/\" slug=\"pirate-ship\">pirate ship</a> court has <a data-ref-id=\"3055-3960\" href=\"/cannonball/3055-3960/\" slug=\"cannonball\">cannonballs</a> fired at you throughout the match.",

Players navigate basic platforming challenges on the overworld with both characters and fight enemies in turn-based form. However, this game advances this system by adding two more playable characters, Baby Mario and Baby Luigi. These two infants spend the majority of the game riding on the shoulders of their older selves. Certain sections of the game require the babies to leave the adults and wander alone, often to find a switch hidden in an area too small for the elder pair. Additionally, these two aid in combat as the only bearers of hammers.  <br/> <br/>In the original game, Mario and Luigi earned hammers early on. In this game, Baby Mario and Baby Luigi earn hammers instead. As such, hammer attacks can only be used if the Babies are available in combat. Another change to the system is the Bros Attack Item. This system replaces the Bros Attack system seen in the previous game with a new system. This system uses an item in your inventory to attack an opponent.  <br/> <br/>Generally, the power of an item is increased by responding to onscreen events. For instance, with a green shell Mario and Luigi's respective buttons must be tapped whenever the shell is close enough to kick, otherwise the attack ends. Additionally, if a baby is riding the shell it is possible to deal additional damage by tapping the baby's button as the shell hits the target. This system varies from item to item. Also, Mario and Luigi are able to perform standard jump attack, the game introduces a feature to add a critical strike on to your attack by tapping the button corresponding to the character, Mario being A and Luigi being B. With Baby Mario and Baby Luigi on the brothers' shoulders, you are also able to attack with them by hitting the corresponding button, X for Baby Mario and Y for Baby Luigi, before you hit the enemy resulting in four attacks per turn, if successfully landed.<br/><h3>Moves</h3>Some new moves appear in Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time. These moves are useful in the platforming sequences of the game, as navigating most environments would be impossible otherwise. These moves are learned as you progress through the game, primarily from the Toadsworths of past and present. <br/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><b>Spin Jump</b> -This move allows Mario and Luigi to spin. This spin gives them extra distance when they jump. It also triggers the Baby Spin. </li> <li><b>Ball </b>- This move allows Mario and Luigi to roll into a ball. This spin allows them to move with great spin. It also triggers the Baby Cakes. </li> <li><b>Hammer </b>- This move makes Baby Mario use his hammer. </li> <li><b>Drill</b> - This move allows Baby Mario and Baby Luigi to tunnel underground. This allows them to move under certain objects, and also allows them to dig beans. </li> <li><b>Baby Spin</b> - This moves allows the babies to move great distances. By using the Spin Jump and touching the babies while spinning, the babies receive a lift and corkscrew until they hit the ground. This gives greater distance than the spin jump, however, the babies lose height as they go. </li> <li><b>Baby Cakes</b> - This move crushes the babies into little pancakes. This is triggered by rolling over the babies while in ball form. While flat, the babies have great air resistance and can be lifted by fans. The can also move into thin spaces. </li> <li><b>Water Spit</b> - At certain times, the babies find a small spring. Baby Mario can drink from this spring, and then spit up the water when hit by Baby Luigi's hammer. This is useful when trapped by fire, and can also be used to hit certain items out of the sky. </li> </ul> <h3>Bros. Items</h3>The Bros. Items are used for attack. Each is useful depending on the circumstances. All of these items require at least one Mario and one Luigi, and some require all four brothers.<br/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><b>Green Shells</b> - These items are volleyed between Mario and Luigi. To use, one throws the shell. It automatically hits the target. It then bounces towards the other brother. The other brother must then hit his button so that the shell will bounce back. It keeps going until the player misses a button press or the enemy dies. If a baby is present, the baby's button can be hit on contact with the target to do extra damage. </li> <li><b>Red shells</b> - Same as green shells, but more powerful. Also, if the target dies, the shell advances an enemy and you can keep dealing damage. </li> <li><b>Bros. Flowers</b> - These items spawn a fireball that alternates between the brothers. The player mashes the button of the brother with the power of the fireball to throw fireballs at the enemies. Potentially deals the burning status effect. </li> <li><b>Ice Flowers</b> - Same as Bros. Flowers, but deals ice damage. Potentially deals a downgrade status effect. </li> <li><b>Smash Eggs</b> - These items are essentially vertical versions of green shells. An egg is thrown in the air, and will come down on either Mario or Luigi. The brother it comes down on must kick the egg back into the air. After several hits, the egg cracks and may dispense an item. </li> <li><b>Pocket Chomps</b> - These items spawn a chain chomp that chases a brother. The player must hit that brother's button when he lands on an enemy. The more you do this, the faster the brother goes. When you miss, the brother slows down. When the chain chomp catches the brother, the turn ends. If a baby is present, it is possible to hit his button as he passes the enemy to do additional damage. </li> <li><b>Cannonballers </b>- These items require all four brothers to be present. It launches them all into the air, and you must hit the corresponding button as he hits the enemy. </li> <li><b>Trampolines </b>- These items work the same way, but the brothers can launch again if they hit at the right time. </li> <li><b>Copy Flowers</b> - These items work the same way as the trampolines, but are faster and will hit the same enemy instead of random enemies. </li> <li><b>Mix Flowers</b> - These items create an enormous fireball on the top screen. The brothers spread around the fireball, and one of them throws a fireball into the air. The player must mash this brother's button to build power in the fireball and keep it from falling. The fireball will periodically switch brothers, and if the wrong button is hit, iceballs are thrown at the fireball. This causes the fireball to descend. After the fireball falls, the turn ends. </li> </ul>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2>Dance Dance Revolution Mario Mix is the only DDR game  available for the Nintendo GameCube. The gameplay is similar to the Dance Dance Revolution series, the only difference being a mode called the 'Mush Mode' that features various Mario enemies instead of arrows.<br/><br/><br/><h2>Story Mode</h2><br/>The Story Mode is the main feature of the game, and can be played by either Mario or Luigi.<br/><br/>The Story Mode starts with Waluigi stealing the Music Keys from Truffle Towers. However, as he is about to steal them, the four Music Keys scatter across the Mushroom Kingdom, except one which Waluigi keeps. Toad sees this happening and quickly runs off to find Mario (or Luigi, depending on who the player chose).<br/><br/><h3>World 1</h3><br/>Toad finds Mario (or Luigi) and tells him about what happened, Mario then agrees to go get the Music Keys back, so they set off for Truffle Towers. When they make it there it turns out Waluigi has locked himself in, and them throws a Bob-omb at Mario and toad, knocking them into a nearby pipe. after getting out, Mario and Toad go to a Lakitu shop and notice a key. Toad asks about the key, and the Lakitu tells them he will give them the key if they get rid of the Koopa Troopas in the Lakitu's farm. Afterwards, Lakitu gives them the key and they rush back to Truffle towers to confront Waluigi. Mario challenges Waluigi to a dance-off, and the winner gets to keep the Music Key. After Mario wins Toad and Mario hop in the SS Brass to go find the other three Music Keys. Their first stop is Isle Delfino.<br/><br/><h3>World 2</h3><br/>On arrival the SS Brass gets caught in a Tweester, making it spin around Hotel Delfino, turning it into an odd shape. The owner of Hotel Delfino, Toadette, comes out and yells at Mario, telling him to fix it. After Mario fixes the Hotel, he and Toad jump into the SS Brass again and take off, bu<span>t</span> <span>unfortunately</span><span>they cra</span>sh yet again onto another island. Luckily they find a shop owned by Pirate Lakitu. The Pirate Lakitu agrees to help repair the ship if Mario can beat him in a dance off. The Pirate Lakitu improves the SS Brass and now it can work as a submarine. Underwater, Mario and Toad come across a large Blooper holding the second Music Key. After Mario Defeats the Blooper, Mario takes the second Music Key and they fly to their next destination, Mushroom Park.<br/><br/><h3>World 3</h3><br/>At the entrance to Mushroom Park, Mario and Toad come across two Hammer Bros. The Hammer Bros agree to open the park gates if Mario can beat them in a dance-off. After Mario defeats them, Mario and toad enter Mushroom Park and see that Wario has the third Music Key. Mario and Toad chase Wario through a Roller Coaster and a Haunted House, before finally catching up with Wario at a Ferris Wheel. Wario then reveals his dream of starring in his own game called Dance Dance Revolution: Wario Mix. Wario then challenges Mario to a dance-off on the Ferris Wheel for the music key. Mario wins the dance-off and he and Toad head to the next destination, Freeze Mountain.<br/><br/><h3>World 4</h3><br/>They arrive at Freeze Mountain and attempt to climb it, but they find that it is too slippery to climb. Instead they find a warp pipe and go in there. They land on a little island made of ice surrounded by Cheep Cheeps. The island moves towards another warp pipe, which Mario and Toad jump in. They jump out of the pipe, which happens to be very near the top of the mountain. They notice a log house and toad complains that he is cold, so they go in the log house to rests. After resting Mario and toad proceed up the mountain. At the very top they find the music key inside of a giant Freezie. Mario melts the Freezie and takes the Music Key. Mario and Toad then find some sleds and sled down the mountain back to the SS Brass to go back to Truffle Towers.<br/><br/><h3>The 'End'?</h3><br/>When Mario and Toad make it back to Truffle Towers, Mario puts the Music Keys back and returns home. Unfortunately, a few minutes later Toad comes back to Mario telling him to go to Truffle Towers, where Bowser is stealing all four Music Keys in his Koopa Kar. Bowser leaves, and Toad calls the SS Brass once again to chase Bowser.<br/><br/><h3>World 5</h3><br/>Toad and Mario chase Bowser into the Dark Land. While flying towards Bowser's Castle, it starts firing Bullet Bills at the SS Brass. Mario survives the Bullet bills and enters Bowser's Castle. Mario then tries to take the Music Keys but Bowser doesn't let him, and instead challenges Mario to a dance-off, and the winner gets to keep the music keys. Mario then defeats Bowser and takes the Music Keys. Mario then takes the Music Keys back to Truffle Towers and finally, goes back home.<br/><br/><h2>Mush Mode</h2><br/>The Mush Mode replaced some arrows with various Mario enemies, this mode is always on in Story Mode and can be turned on or off in free play, the enemies included (order of appearance) are:<br/><br/><h3>Goomba</h3>The Goomba simply replaces an arrow. Except the Goomba does not show which arrow the player must press. Instead they must notice which column the Goomba appeared in and hit that arrow.<br/><br/><h3>Koopa Troopa</h3>Similar to the Goomba, except on the first hit the Koopa Troopa gets knocked into its shell and moved down the column, then on the second hit the enemy if defeated. If the second hit is a 'perfect' the Koopa shell will knock away all the arrows on the screen in that column.<br/><br/><h3>Bob-omb and Podoboo</h3>Bob-ombs appear above the arrows and Podoboos scroll up the columns. If the player misses a Podoboo then it sets the bob-omb alight, greatly reducing the player's dance meter. If playing in versus mode (or a dance off in story mode) the Podoboo gets passes over to the opponent's column.<br/><br/><h3>Cheep-Cheep</h3>Similar to the Goomba, except the Cheep-Cheep enters the screen from the side so the player doesn't have a lot of time to figure out which arrow to hit. These can also be passes to opponents in dance offs.<br/><br/><h3>Spiny</h3>If a player steps on a Spiny their dance meter decreases significantly. There are two different types of Spinies, red Spinies and green Spinies. The red Spinies move faster than the green Spinies.<br/><br/><h3>Mini-Blooper</h3>Works the same as a Goomba, but if the player misses the Mini-Blooper, ink covers the bottom of the screen so the player cannot see arrows coming up.<br/><br/><h3>Blooper Tentacle</h3>A Blooper tentacle scrolls up the screen, if the player misses the tentacle attacks the dance meter, making it drop significantly.<br/><br/><h3>Hammer</h3>These are the same as the Bob-omb and Podoboo combo, if the player misses it, it will explode, greatly reducing the player's dance meter.<br/><br/><h3>Coin Switch</h3>Hitting a Coin Switch turns all of the arrows into coins, which can be used to buy  songs in free play. The more perfects the player gets, the longer the arrows remian as coins.<br/><br/><h3>Boos</h3>Boos appear when a Big Boo is at the bottom of the screen. Mini-Boos are the same as Goombas, but hitting them causes the Big Boo to move down. The Big Boo moves up whenever an arrow is missed, the more the Big Boo appears over the arrow columns, so the higher up he is the harder it is to see the arrows.<br/><br/><h3>Cheep-Cheep</h3>Cheep-Cheeps appear again, but this time they hit arrows already the screen, causing them to move into a new column.<br/><br/><h3>Fire Flower and Big Freezie</h3>Identical to the Mini-Boo and Big Boo combo.<br/><br/><h3>Ice Spinies</h3>Identical to Spinies, but they only come in one colour and move at the same speed as normal arrows.<br/><br/><h3>Bullet Bills</h3>Similar to the Hammer and the Bob-omb and Podoboo combo, if the player misses the Bullet Bill is hits the player's dance meter. If the player hits the Bullet Bill, however, the Bullet Bill ricochets back and hits the Bullet Bill Blaster at the bottom of the screen. If hit three times the Blaster is destroyed.<br/><br/><h3>Rockets</h3>The player has to collect the three parts of the Rocket, when all three parts are collected the Rocket is formed and fired at Bowser. If the player fails to do this so many times before the song ends, the player fails the song.<br/><br/><br/><h2>Song List</h2><br/><br/><h3>Starting Song</h3><br/><em>Up, Down, Left, Right!</em><br/>Twinkle Twinkle Little Star<br/><br/><br/><h3>World 1 Songs</h3><br/><em>Here We Go!</em><br/>Super Mario Bros. 1 - Overworld<br/><br/><em>Underground Mozart</em><br/>Mario Bros. - Tutorial/Game Start<br/><br/><em>Pipe Pop</em><br/>Public Domain - Turkish March<br/><br/><em>Garden Boogie</em><br/>Public Domain - Carmen<br/><br/><em>Destruction Dance</em><br/>Wrecking Crew - Bonus Stage<br/><br/><br/><h3>World 2 Songs</h3><br/><em>Jump!

The player has to shoot giant robotic fists at the Koopas while avoiding the Toads. The player shoots by hitting left, up or right. After shooting the arm has to reload before the player can shoot again.<br/><br/><h3>Chain-Chomp Chase</h3>A Chain Chomp is Chasing the player, the player has to run away by rapidly pressing left and right. If the player survives 10 seconds, the player wins the mini-game.<br/><br/><h3>Avalanche!</h3>The player has to dodge giant snowballs coming down a mountain by pressing left and right.<br/><br/><h3>Hidden Treasure</h3>Two chests are on screen and either one coin, 100 coins or a 1-up mushroom goes in them. The chests then spin around rapidly. When they stop spining the player has to choose a chest with left and right and jump with up to get what is inside the chest.<br/><br/><h3>Block Treasure</h3>Three blocks appear above the player, the player has to move with left and right and jump with up to collect as many coins as they can in the time limit.<br/><br/><h3>Coin Collection</h3>The player is on a cloud and has to jump with up or duck with down to avoid floating Spinies and collect coins. If the player is hit then they fall off the cloud and get Lakitu to get them again, losing time.<br/><br/><h3>Whee!</h3>The player falls onto a trampoline which propels them upwards. The higher the player goes the more coins they can collect.<br/><br/><h3>Note Pickup</h3>The player is on a moving conveyer belt and has to collect as much notes as they can. They can jump left and right to collect notes on either side of the conveyer belt, and have to jump back before it moves too far away. They also have to jump up to avoid spinning bars and bob-ombs.<br/><br/><h3>Fire Up The SS Brass</h3>The player is on the SS Brass and has to get through a large tunnel. Every so often there is a barrier with one hole in it, either up, down, left or right. The player has to<span>hit the</span><span>corresponding</span><span>arro</span>w to move the SS Brass through the opening.",

It was released for the <a href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">Nintendo DS</a> on September 14, 2009, in the United States. The game was first announced at <a href=\"../../../nintendo/65-90/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nintendo</a>'s conference in October 2008. The game includes several new features, such as the ability to play as <a href=\"../../../bowser/94-337/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bowser</a>. Bowser's Inside Story received critical acclaim, often regarded as being the best in the series.</p><p style=\"\">The gameplay is split between playing as <a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Mario</a> and <a href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\">Luigi</a> (as a team) and as Bowser. The game features multiple uses of every Nintendo DS capability, both in controls and graphics. Like the other games in the series, most battles rely on reflex/timing-based attacks. Every attack can be enhanced with well-timed button presses. Likewise, most enemy attacks can be partially blocked, avoided, or even countered, again, with appropriately timed actions. While similar, Bowser uses a different arsenal, and his special attacks make use of the touch-screen and, unfortunately, the microphone, unlike the mustachioed brothers.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1171253-265x.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1171253\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1171253-265x.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1171253\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/1171253-265x.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Bowser Battling an Overweight Goomba.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Mario &amp; Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story uses a mix of real-time overworld platforming and a turn-based battle system.</p><p style=\"\">For the first time in the series, the platforming overworld sections are not entirely three-dimensional. While the brothers are inside of Bowser's body, the gameplay is in two dimensions, similar to the classic <a href=\"/super-mario-bros/3030-15544/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15544\">Super Mario Bros.</a> (except more overworld-based, rather than level-based). During the times the player controls Bowser, as well as later in the game when the brothers escape Bowser's body, the gameplay is in the classic Mario &amp; Luigi 3D overworld.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1171246-256x.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1171246\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1171246-256x.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1171246\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/1171246-256x.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The Bros. Inside Bowser's Body.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The overworld includes some puzzle solving at times, as well as the use of multiple learned abilities. When reaching an impassible obstacle, usually an ability found later in the game will be required to proceed at that particular point such as the spin jump and hammer Mini Mario, among others. The overworld is also how the player visits towns, such as Toad Town, or the small market inside of Bowser's body. At these towns, the player can purchase upgraded equipment such as new overalls, gloves, etc, as well as purchase items to use inside of battle. Upon viewing an enemy in the overworld map, the player can actively attempt to avoid the battle, passively engage in battle by simply running into the enemy, or</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1171252-263x.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1171252\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1171252-263x.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1171252\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/1171252-263x.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The Mario Brothers in Battle.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">actively engage in battle by either jumping on the enemy or hammering the enemy. In addition to playing as the Mario Brothers, the player also actively controls Bowser for a significant portion of the game. Using Bowser is similar to the Mario Bros. except that he cannot jump, but has other abilities like flame breath, ground pound and more. In the overworld, he can access areas that the Bros. cannot and visa-versa.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2788/1044228-ntr_marioluigi3_02ss05_e3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1044228\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2788/1044228-ntr_marioluigi3_02ss05_e3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1044228\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2788/1044228-ntr_marioluigi3_02ss05_e3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Bowser in a Battle with a Castle.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The Battle system for Bowser's Inside Story stays fairly similar to previous incarnations in the series. It is a turn based combat system, so the Mario Brothers each take a turn, and the enemies take a turn, with turn order based on the speed statistic. The Brothers can attack by jumping, hammering, or using special Bros. attacks requiring very specific timing depending on the attack, but with a very large damage if it lands perfectly. In the standard attacks, pressing a specific button again for jumping, or releasing a button at the right time can give a damage boost. The Bros. in battle can also dodge and counter-attack by either jumping at very specific points of the enemies attacks, making the battle system feel very rhythm based both in attacking and in defending.</p><p style=\"\">Bowser handles similarly in battle, except that he is the only one in battle against the enemies, and his standard attacks are based on punching, fire breath, and vacuum breath,</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1182928-gb005.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1182928\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1182928-gb005.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1182928\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/1182928-gb005.png\"></a><figcaption>The Statistics Screen.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">while his dodges/counter-attacks are based on punching and using his shell to protect himself. His special attacks are based upon using the stylus of the DS to use his minions to attack, such as a Goomba Storm. In addition, at specific points in the game, Bowser may find himself with a larger enemy to face and he grows accordingly. These battles are entirely stylus based, and the DS is held like a book.</p><p style=\"\">Finally, Bowser's Inside Story is an RPG, and the statistic system reflects this. After battles, either the Bros, Bowser, or both may receive experience. In typical RPG fashion, once the experience reaches a certain level, the characters level up. This area is virtually unchanged from previous incarnations in the series. Upon leveling up, most or all stats increase by a fixed amount, and the player can choose one statistic to boost an additional amount based on a roulette wheel. In this game, upon reaching certain levels, the character also increases in \"rank\", i.e. from mushroom rank to star rank. This dictates new powers or shops available to the player.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style=\"\">As Bowser's Inside Story begins, we are notified of a disease afflicting <a href=\"/the-mushroom-kingdom/3035-14/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-14\">the Mushroom Kingdom</a>. An illness known only as \"the Blorbs\" is spreading among the cattle-like populace of the Kingdom; the Blorbs causes the infected to swell up in size into a spherical shape, and then roll away, and just keep rolling. The condition gets so serious, that <a href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-709\">Princess Peach</a> calls for an emergency meeting at her castle.</p><p style=\"\">At the meeting, we are introduced the Star Sprites, magical beings (which are totally not the <a href=\"/shine-sprite/3055-1984/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1984\">Shine Sprites</a> from <a href=\"/super-mario-sunshine/3030-6649/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6649\">Super Mario Sunshine</a>) who Princess Peach believes can help with the epidemic. Unfortunately, it appears that the Star Sprites cannot do anything unless they first know the cause of the outbreak. <a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Mario</a> and <a href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\">Luigi</a> show up late to the meeting. While there, it is discovered that all persons infected with the Blorbs purchased Blorb Mushrooms (obvious in hindsight) from a street vendor, and <a href=\"/toadsworth/3005-1304/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1304\">Toadsworth</a> sends Mario and Luigi out to find him. Before they can, however, <a href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-337\">Bowser</a> comes into the meeting uninvited. Bowser came under the pretense of genuinely wanting to attend the meeting, though it is obvious to all that he merely wants to cause more of his obsessive havoc. Mario confronts him (Luigi is sleeping through the entire thing), and Bowser is quickly dispatched and (literally) thrown out of the castle by Princess Peach.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62615/1185150-bowser_s_body.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1185150\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62615/1185150-bowser_s_body.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1185150\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62615/1185150-bowser_s_body.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The entire body of Bowser.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Bowser is awakened in the middle of a forest by <a href=\"/magikoopa/3015-3537/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3537\">Magikoopa</a>, and proceeds to find his way out. On the way, he encounters a shady mushroom vendor, who talks in a strange dialect. He gives the Koopa King a mushroom, claiming it will help him defeat Mario. Stupid as Bowser is, he ingests the mushroom without hesitation. It is then revealed that the mysterious mushroom vendor is none other than <a href=\"/fawful/3005-2475/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2475\">Fawful</a>, the former henchman of the late <a href=\"/cackletta/3005-7182/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-7182\">Cackletta</a>, the villain of <a href=\"/mario-luigi-superstar-saga/3030-9306/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9306\">the first Mario &amp; Luigi game</a>, in disguise, and he has just fed Bowser a mushroom that makes him uncontrollably inhale everything in sight.</p><p style=\"\">Meanwhile, back at the meeting in Princess Peach's castle, Bowser stumbles back in (castle security being kind of crap) and inhales everybody in the meeting room. An inexplicably miniaturized Mario awakens <a href=\"/bowsers-body/3035-2578/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2578\">inside Bowser's body</a>, and begins to explore. At this point the game switches to a 2D perspective, and becomes similar to a classic <a href=\"/mario/3025-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1\">Mario</a> game. Mario finds a Star Sprite stuck inside an amoeba, and frees it. They continue to explore, until Mario finds Luigi stuck inside yet another amoeba. Mario and Luigi explore Bowser's entrails together, and soon enough discover, oddly, two boxes with hammers inside. After solving a couple of simple puzzles, they are able to open the boxes and get the hammers out, which help them progress further.</p><p style=\"\">With the Mario Bros. and Bowser incapacitated, Fawful takes control of Peach's Castle and <a href=\"/midbus/3005-13033/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13033\">Midbus</a> gains control of Bowser's Castle. While inside of Bowser, Mario and Luigi begin stimulating parts of the King Koopa's innards, increasing his strength and agility (and in some cases his size). Bowser uses his new vitality to make his way back to his castle to defeat Fawful and reclaim his former glory, completely unaware of the fact his greatest rival (and his less successful older brother) is not only romping around inside of him, but is directly responsible for him becoming actually competent for once.</p><p style=\"\">Eventually, Fawful extracts the Princess from inside of Bowser and uses her to gain possession of the Dark Star, an object capable of tremendous power and unspeakable evil. Mario and Luigi find passage out of Bowser's body and discover a blockade outside of Peach's Castle. In order to break through the blockade and cure the Blorbs, Mario and Luigi discover they must collect three Star Cures from three different sages. After completing this task (which takes them throughout the kingdom), the blockade in front of Peach's Castle is destroyed.</p><p style=\"\">Bowser takes this opportunity to finally assault the castle. Inside, he finds Fawful attempting to drain the energy of the Dark Star. Fawful is only able to consume half of the Dark Star's power before he is stopped by the Koopa King. After defeating a Dark Star enhanced Midbus, Bowser accidentally ingests the portion of the Dark Star that still remains. Inside Bowser, Mario and Luigi attempt to nab the Dark Star as it makes its way throughout Bowser's body. Interestingly, they discover that the Dark Star is consuming and copying portions of Bowser's DNA. In doing so, the Dark Star is able to copy Bowser's powers, such as his fire breath.</p><p style=\"\">As this is all going on within him, Bowser confronts a Dark Power Infused Fawful and defeats him in a pitched battle. Just as Bowser thinks victory is at hand, the Dark Star makes its way out of Bowser's body and absorbs the missing portion of itself that Fawful stole. Bowser then engages in battle with <a href=\"/dark-bowser/3005-14307/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14307\">Dark Bowser</a>, who uses Bowser's own abilities against him. Through cooperation (unbeknownst to him) with Mario and Luigi inside him, Bowser defeats Dark Bowser and finally destroys the Dark Star.</p><p style=\"\">Following the battle, all of the characters from the Mushroom Kingdom whom Bowser inhaled at the beginning of the game are ejected out of Bowser's body. Bowser, enraged to find that Mario and Luigi had been exploring his innards and bouncing around inside him, engages the brothers in a battle that is depicted in a series of still pictures during the credits. Naturally, Bowser is defeated and sent scurrying back to his own castle. The story ends with Bowser recovering from his injuries in bed while ordering his minions to repair the castle. A bird appears and delivers Bowser a thank you cake from Peach, Mario, and Luigi.</p><h2>Main Characters</h2><h3>Mario and Luigi</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14741/1294844-marioluigiml3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1294844\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14741/1294844-marioluigiml3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1294844\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14741/1294844-marioluigiml3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Mario &amp; Luigi</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Always ready to help when needed, <a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Mario</a> and <a href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\">Luigi</a> are once again tasked with saving the Mushroom Kingdom and Princess Peach from danger.

His job is to protect Fawful at all costs and to deal with any enemies that might pose a risk to his plans.

The Life counter was increased to 1000 lives.</p><h2>TV series</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/100719/1439500-2977.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1439500\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/100719/1439500-2977.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1439500\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/100719/1439500-2977.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The TV series based on the game with the same name.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In addition to the video game, there was also a TV show based on the game with the same name in 1991 and It was also the third and final Mario cartoon in the series (The other two are The Super Mario Bros. Super Show and The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3). The show was produced by Nintendo in association with DiC Entertainment. The series span only thirteen episodes and it took place in Dome City in the TV series. The cast of characters include Oogtar, Yoshi, and the Mario Bros. This was also the second show to feature the <a href=\"/koopalings/3015-3991/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3991\">Koopalings</a> in the series. Each one of the 13 episodes has a song that corresponds to the troubles that they cause during the episode. For example: If Mario and Yoshi were playing football against the Koopalings, then the song that corresponds to \"The Yoshi Shuffle\" is called \"Fight to the Finish\". This chart shows the episode and the song that plays in the episode.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><h2>Speed Running </h2><p style=\"\">Super Mario World has taken it's place among speed runners, the streamlined levels allowing players to keep moving or find a way to keep moving with out ever stopping for anything.without using any glitches or bugs in the game.

      "deck": "Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is a 1999 remake of the 1985 classic, Super Mario Bros. It featured many updates from the original version including fixes for several glitches and the ability to play as Luigi at any time.",
      "description": "<h2>The Original Super Mario Bros.</h2><p style=\"\">Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is nearly identical to the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-15544\" href=\"/super-mario-bros/3030-15544/\">original Super Mario Bros</a>. experience on the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-21\" href=\"/nes/3045-21/\">NES</a>. None of the levels were modified in any way from the original set, at least when played through the first time. New to this version, you can save anytime onto one of three separate accounts and there are simple overworld maps depicting each of the eight worlds. As a new feature, the Photo album is comparable to a modern <u>Achievements</u> system, awarding small pictures or vignettes that can be printed on a Game Boy Printer. Also, the game now includes a battery pack powered leaderboard, making the points system from the original game matter. The Gameboy Color's screen is not as wide as that of the original NES's display, so developers compensated for this by allowing the player to go back a short distance, press up or down to look around or press Select to recenter camera. Those points aside, the game is a dead ringer.</p><h2>Star Mode</h2><p style=\"\">When you finish the original game the first time, a new star designation goes beside your save account and the game starts over with some variations to make the game more difficult. For example, in star mode, all of the Goombas are replaced with Buzzy Beetles and all floating platforms are considerably shortened. The effects of this mode do not consistently increase the difficulty (unchanged enemies pose no more a threat than before) but completion does prove much more challenging for platforming-intensive stages. When you beat the game on Star Mode, the game lets you choose which level to play and on what mode in the account selection screen.</p><h2>Super Mario Bros: The Lost Levels</h2><p style=\"\">Other than the main game, the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. 2 (aka <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20974\" href=\"/super-mario-bros-the-lost-levels/3030-20974/\">The Lost Levels</a>) is in this release, named Super Mario Bros. For Super Players. To access the levels, you have to beat the default high score in the leaderboards that are held by Luigi in the main game. The format of Lost Levels is nearly identical to the original Mario Bros mechanically and graphically but it is designed to be far more difficult than its predecessor (it's also much more difficult than Star Mode). In addition to demanding better timing and greater levels of finesse, the game actively tries to trick the player with bogus secrets and red herrings, the most notorious of which is a warp zone that takes the player back to World 1 from later Worlds. Lost Levels is also the relatively obscure debut of the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-210\" href=\"/poison-mushroom/3055-210/\">Poison Mushroom</a> which will harm Mario when touched. As with the Super Nintendo version, the game removes the final 9th and A to D worlds, and differences in gameplay between Mario and Luigi.</p><h2>Challenge Mode</h2><p style=\"\">One of the new modes is a challenge mode where each of the original 32 levels have special items hidden in them for Mario to find. The player can choose any level they have beaten on a save in the original game. Challenge Mode has three goals for each level: finding five special red coins, finding the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-588\" href=\"/yoshi-egg/3055-588/\">Yoshi egg</a>, and achieving a score by the end (determined by the development team). There is only one Challenge Mode account and it can be reset if desired.</p><h2>You vs. Boo</h2><p style=\"\">Another new mode is a versus mode either against <a data-ref-id=\"3005-370\" href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\">Luigi</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3005-943\" href=\"/boo/3005-943/\">Boo</a> in a race to the flag. This can be done either as a singleplayer to two-player game with a link cable. The objective is to dodge a level full of obstacles, traps, and hazards to beat your opponent to the flag. There are eight levels to choose from and though they are graphically similar to the original game, none of the level designs are taken from the original. Each map has a series of buttons that players can hit to change the status of certain blocks, altering their existence or spikiness. There are two states the buttons toggle and one is beneficial to each contestant, striking a balance between making sure the layout is ideal and just gunning for the flag.</p><p style=\"\">Boo is your opponent when playing against the computer and he simply floats by at a constant rate in the background instead of being blocked by obstacles, making these much more of a race against the clock than the multiplayer version. However, the computer will switch the state of the blocks in the level at a fairly constant rate, so this danger is not averted.</p><h2>Toad's Toy Box</h2><p style=\"\">Every time the player makes significant progress in a mode or in the original game, things open up in <a data-ref-id=\"3005-845\" href=\"/toad/3005-845/\">Toad</a>'s Toy Box. The calendar, is just a basic calendar showing the current date, but goes on from 1 AD to 3000 AD, and has some filled out dates such as the original Japanese release date for Super Mario Bros. The fortune teller just shows a random item and a small fortune text like a fortune cookie, and occasionally a Super Fortune, awarding 5 extra lives in all games. The\"?\" room gets filled with Toads as you rescue them in the game, playing out little animations and unlocking more pictures printable via the GameBoy Printer. The last ones open up a simple music creator similar to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-8791\" href=\"/mario-paint/3030-8791/\">Mario Paint</a>, and you can redo the iconic opening music. \"Where's <a data-ref-id=\"3005-700\" href=\"/yoshi/3005-700/\">Yoshi</a>?\" section is a randomized hint machine that will choose random levels and show the approximate location of the Yoshi Egg in them for Challenge Mode.</p><h2>Secrets</h2><h3>Start a game with 10 lives instead of 5</h3><p style=\"\">To start a game with 10 lives (new file), go to the toy box, and select the fortune teller option. Now pick a card. Keep on picking until you get an \"Extremely Lucky\" card, and you should see a 5-Up on the card.</p><p style=\"\">now you can start a game with 10 instead of 5 lives.</p>",

Before a new stage is played (or after a continue from losing all lives), players can switch between four characters (each with their own unique abilities and attributes):</p><ul><li><a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\"><strong>Mario</strong></a> - The titular hero and red-suited plumber, Mario is the most balanced character of the four.</li><li><a href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\"><strong>Luigi</strong></a> - Mario's brother and a green-suited plumber, Luigi is not as fast as Mario (and does not pick up items as fast), but he has the highest jumping power in the game.</li><li><a href=\"/toad/3005-845/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-845\"><strong>Toad</strong></a> - The princess's attendant, Toad has the weakest jumping ability in the game, but is the fastest character (in both movement and picking up items).</li><li><a href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-709\"><strong>Princess</strong></a> - The princess of the Mushroom Kingdom is the slowest character in the game (in terms of both movement and picking up items) and does not jump as high as Mario, but she has the ability to temporarily float in the air (by holding down the jump button while in the air).</li></ul><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Players use the \"A\" button to jump and the \"B\" button to run, pick up objects/enemies, and throw held objects/enemies.

Holding the down direction on the d-pad causes the character to charge up a \"<a href=\"/super-jump/3015-694/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-694\">super jump</a>\", in which the next jump will be even higher than usual.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Unlike traditional Mario games, where the hero defeats enemies by jumping on them, Super Mario Bros. 2 requires players to dispose enemies by either throwing them off the screen, throwing them at other enemies, or by throwing other objects (such as vegetables) at them.</p><h2>Sub-Space and Warping</h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-494169\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/494169-super_mario_bros._2_1.png\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/494169-super_mario_bros._2_1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-494169\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/494169-super_mario_bros._2_1.png\"></a><figcaption>Luigi entering Sub-Space in Level 1-1, finding a secret Mushroom item.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In each level, the player can find a special flask (the Magic Potion) which, when thrown, summons a door to a unique parallel area called Sub-Space.

For shame.</figcaption></figure>Mario Clash is a remake of the Mario Bros. arcade game for the Virtual Boy. It features many of the same  enemies as the  original game,  plus a few new additions like Paragoombas  and Boo Buddies. Since the game attempts to show off the 3-D capabilities of the Virtual Boy, Mario is able and often required to attack enemies by tossing Koopa shells at them from opposing sides of the playing field. To make sure this is possible, there are two Koopas on screen at all times. Each stage can only be completed when Mario defeats every single enemy on screen. There is a mushroom counter on the upper-right hand corner of the playing field. It counts down once for every non-Koopa that Mario defeats. If he destroys all of them, he enters \"Fever Time,\" where a hit from any direction with a Koopa shell will defeat any enemy and scoring is doubled.<br/><br/><h3>Mini-Game</h3><br/>Every few stages there is an interlude for a mini-game. Mario must collect as many coins as possible to earn extra lives.<br/>",

The game came out on November 8, 2004, and was re-released for the Nintendo <a data-ref-id=\"3045-36\" href=\"/wii/3045-36/\">Wii</a> on March 9, 2009 with new motion controls.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/913403-40.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-913403\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/913403-40.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-913403\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3009/913403-40.jpg\"></a><figcaption>A match on Luigi's Gimmick Court, where ghosts can slow down characters.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The basic format of Mario Power Tennis is similar to other tennis video games. There are a variety of characters, each with different styles like, \"Speed,\" \"Technique,\" or \"All-Around,\" which the player can use as a guide to how that character moves or how they handle the ball. Generally, the basic rules of tennis apply, and you can play with singles or doubles. A shot which bounces within court limits and out without a player returning the ball is considered a point. However, a number of Nintendo-themed touches alter the sport's basic rules.</p><p style=\"\">Rallying the ball back and forth builds up your Special Shot, which you can then release at any time. These are over-the-top moves designed to bring one player or team back from what may have been a defeat. There are two types of special shots, offensive and defensive. For example, using <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3682\" href=\"/boo/3015-3682/\">Boo's</a> offensive special will cause a more powerful curve shot that is surrounded by small ghosts, obscuring the opposing team's view of the ball. His defensive shot will cause him to split up into a dozen or more Boos, allowing him to return the ball even if he is nowhere near it. These special abilities can be turned off if the player wants a more traditional experience.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/913411-26.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-913411\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/913411-26.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-913411\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3009/913411-26.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Mario's offensive special, where he whacks an incoming ball with a giant hammer.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Gimmick Courts also add in more Nintendo flavor. A number of courts borrow imagery from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6649\" href=\"/super-mario-sunshine/3030-6649/\">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-311\" href=\"/donkey-kong/3030-311/\">Donkey Kong</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-10996\" href=\"/luigis-mansion/3030-10996/\">Luigi's Mansion</a>, and so on. These courts have special features that may alter the flow of the game. For example, on the Donkey Kong court, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3875\" href=\"/klaptrap/3015-3875/\">Klaptraps</a> walk across the net. If the ball hits a Klaptrap, it will run into the opposing team's court and latch onto them, making them slower and putting them at a disadvantage.</p><p style=\"\">The game can be played with friends via local multiplayer that supports up to 4 players.</p><h2>Challenge Modes</h2><p style=\"\">A number of challenge modes complement the game's Tournament and Exhibition (quick action) modes. These are akin to <a data-ref-id=\"3015-116\" href=\"/minigames/3015-116/\">minigames</a> but still use the game's basic controls. These challenges usually require you to maintain control of the ball and where it is landing. You may need to get balls through rings floating above the court, or use colored balls to paint a picture. Completing Tournaments with different characters as well as completing challenges will unlock hidden characters and other extras.</p><h2>New Play Control - Wii Version</h2><p style=\"\">Mario Power Tennis was re-released on Nintendo <a data-ref-id=\"3045-36\" href=\"/wii/3045-36/\">Wii</a> as part of the company's New Play Control line. This version has some small graphical improvements (mostly in the form of increased sharpness) as well as a Nunchuck and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1304\" href=\"/wii-remote/3055-1304/\">Remote</a> control scheme. Diagonal swipes of the remote do regular shots, horizontal swipes do slices, upward swipes do lobs, and smashing downward when a star is painted on the court will do a power shot. Special moves can be activated by using A or B plus a swinging motion.</p><p style=\"\">Critics have vocalized their opinions that the motion controls, while functional, are no substitute for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-23\" href=\"/gamecube/3045-23/\">Gamecube</a>'s traditional, pad-based controls.</p><p style=\"\">On June 10th, 2012, Mario Power Tennis joined the Nintendo Selects line for the Wii.</p><h2>Starting Characters:</h2><h3>Mario:</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/879052-mariopowertennis_charart_0013.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-879052\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/879052-mariopowertennis_charart_0013.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-879052\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3009/879052-mariopowertennis_charart_0013.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Mario Power Tennis - Character Art</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">An \"all around\" type character that has no particular strengths nor weaknesses.

The player races through several courses in the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3962\" href=\"/grand-prix/3015-3962/\" slug=\"grand-prix\">Grand Prix</a>, winning new characters, karts, courses, and modes. The game also has a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-108\" href=\"/cooperative-play/3015-108/\" slug=\"cooperative-play\">cooperative mode</a>, in which one player controls each character in the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-552\" href=\"/go-kart/3055-552/\" slug=\"go-kart\">kart</a>. Up to two players or four players using co-op mode may compete in Grand Prix mode. One player steers the kart while the rear player holds an item and can throw it to the player up front at any time which also allows to hold up to two items. For the first time in the series, a kart can now activate the all new starting boost technique, the Double Dash!!

And... GO!</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Super Mario Kart is split into two singleplayer modes (Mario Kart GP and Time Trial) and three multiplayer modes (Mario Kart GP, Match Race and Battle Mode). In Mario Kart GP one player playes against seven CPU controlled characters in three cups of five races. At first there three cups that you can play on two difficulties (50cc and 100cc). By finishing first in all three cups on 100cc difficulty, a new cup is unlocked, the Special Cup. By winning the fourth cup on 100cc difficulty, the 150cc difficulty level is unlocked. In time trial mode the players race alone, with the goal of beating the other players time.</p><p style=\"\">In multiplayer, Mario Kart GP is the same as in singleplayer, except now there are 6 CPUs and 2 player controlled characters. In Match Race, two players compete against each other without any CPU players on any track in the game. In Battle Mode two players still go head to head against each other without CPUs on the track, but this time on special tracks created specifically for this mode. Each player starts with three balloons which are to be destroyed by the other player. The first player to have all of his balloons destroyed losses the battle.</p><h3>Drivers</h3><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-177\" href=\"/mario/3005-177/\">Mario</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-370\" href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\">Luigi</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-709\" href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709/\">Princess</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-700\" href=\"/yoshi/3005-700/\">Yoshi</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-337\" href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\">Bowser</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-298\" href=\"/donkey-kong-jr/3005-298/\">Donkey Kong Jr.</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3015-2557\" href=\"/koopa-troopa/3015-2557/\">Koopa Troopa</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-845\" href=\"/toad/3005-845/\">Toad</a></li></ul><h3>Items</h3><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"3055-309\" href=\"/koopa-shell/3055-309/\">Green Shell</a>, which can either be fired in a straight line forward or dropped into a stationary position.</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3055-309\" href=\"/koopa-shell/3055-309/\">Red Shell</a>, which acts as a homing missile and will attack the driver in front of you.</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3055-239\" href=\"/banana-peel/3055-239/\">Banana Peel,</a> similar to the green shell, with the exception that its forward shot is fired in an arc.</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3055-3021\" href=\"/feather/3055-3021/\">Feather</a>, which allows the user to jump once - useful for getting over obstacles or finding shortcuts.</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3055-49\" href=\"/super-mushroom/3055-49/\">Mushroom</a>, which gives the user a temporary speed boost.</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3055-1818\" href=\"/star/3055-1818/\">Star</a>, which makes the user invincible to everything, and also causes others to spin out on contact.</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3055-393\" href=\"/lightning-bolt/3055-393/\">Lightning Bolt</a>, which shrinks all other drivers and causes them to drive slower.</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3055-219\" href=\"/coin/3055-219/\">Coin</a>, which gives you a few coins when used. 100 coins will NOT award an extra life.</li></ul><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"3015-3682\" href=\"/boo/3015-3682/\">Ghost</a>, which can steal one item from another driver.</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3055-210\" href=\"/poison-mushroom/3055-210/\">Shrinking Mushroom</a>, which will cause the shrunken effect to anyone who touches it (only usable by CPU controlled Princess and Toad)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3055-120\" href=\"/fireball/3055-120/\">Fireball</a>, a stationary weapon that spins around in a small circle (only usable by CPU controlled Bowser)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3055-607\" href=\"/egg/3055-607/\">Egg</a>, similar to a banana.

Once Mario discovers the weakness of <a href=\"../../tubba-blubba/94-9909/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tubba Blubba</a>, and defeats him in the Windy Mill at the base of Gusty Gulch, the Star Spirit Skolar is freed from his imprisonment by the Boos.</td><td><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5758/922385-gusgulv1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-922385\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5758/922385-gusgulv1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-922385\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5758/922385-gusgulv1.png\"></a><figcaption>Mario and Goombario talking to a resident Boo in Gusty Gulch.</figcaption></figure></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Shy Guy's Toy Box</h3>A toy box that is located inside of an abandoned house in Southern Toad Town, Shy Guy’s Toy Box is home to many <a href=\"../../shy-guy/94-940/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shy Guys</a>, as well as the game’s sixth party member, <a href=\"../../watt/94-4694/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Watt</a>. The Toy Box shrinks anyone who enters it, so although the box is small in a literal sense, when Mario and friends are inside the Toy Box the size of the surrounding area appears to be much larger in scale. Inside of the Toy Box is a large set of railroad tracks and a train, along with several color-coded stations placed at various locations throughout the box. Mario travels to each of these stations to complete a specific task or recover a specific item, before moving on to the next station in the line. Upon defeating the area’s boss, General Guy, the fourth Star Spirit, Muskular, will be freed from his captivity and will return to Star Haven.</td><td><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5758/923184-shyguytoybox.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-923184\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5758/923184-shyguytoybox.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-923184\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5758/923184-shyguytoybox.png\"></a><figcaption>Mario and Watt finding their way through the Shy Guy's Toy Box.</figcaption></figure></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Lavalava Island</h3>Lavalava Island is an island located to the south-west of Toad Town, and is home to a large population of <a href=\"../../yoshi/94-700/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoshis</a>, as well as a sizable volcano named Mt. Lavalava. When Mario initially reaches the island he must help some Yoshis in Yoshi Village find their missing children, who are lost somewhere in the Jade Jungle. Once the children are all found, Mario gains the support of his sixth party member, <a href=\"../../sushie/94-4696/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sushie</a>. After navigating through the Jade Jungle, Mario reaches the Mt. Lavalava volcano. With the “help” of Professor Kolorado, Mario is able to successfully find his way through the volcano and defeat the area’s boss, the Lava Piranha – a giant <a href=\"../../piranha-plant/92-794/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Piranha Plant</a> that dwells inside the molten magma of the volcano and makes use of several fire-based attacks.

The area’s condition of endless sunshine is being endangered by the wicked, cloud-shaped menace Huff N. Puff (as well as his many underlings) who has been implementing a nefarious contraption known as the “Puff-Puff Machine” to create artificial cloud cover and block-out the sun. These actions are a direct threat to many of the residents of Flower Fields, including the plant-like “Bub-ulbs” and the Wise Wisterwood tree. Mario encounters his seventh party member, <a href=\"../../lakilester/94-4545/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lakilester</a>, in Flower Fields. Lakilester is a <a href=\"../../lakitu/94-927/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lakitu</a> that was previously working for Huff N. Puff and who fought against Mario, but after being defeated by Mario, he elects to join forces with him. After Mario succeeds in toppling Huff N.

It is a direct sequel to the Gamecube game <a data-ref-id=\"3030-814\" href=\"/mario-superstar-baseball/3030-814/\" slug=\"mario-superstar-baseball\">    Mario Superstar Baseball</a> which was released on the Gamecube in 2005. The game is similar to other Mario sports titles in that it features the Mario cast bringing a crazy twist to an established sport, baseball!<br/> <br/><h2>Control Methods and Gameplay.<br/></h2> Being for the Wii the game takes advantage of the Wii remote in a manner that is most easily comparable with the Baseball game found in the original <a data-ref-id=\"3030-13328\" href=\"/wii-sports/3030-13328/\" slug=\"wii-sports\">   Wii Sports</a> title. However if the player does not wish to play in this manner they can choose to play with the remote and nunchuck or the remote turned on its side.<br/> <br/>In terms of gameplay it is again comparable to the baseball section of Wii Sports. <br/> <br/><h2>Game Modes.<br/></h2>The game supports a variety of game modes and they are as such: <br/> <br/><h3>Exhibition Mode</h3>The standard sports game mode in which the player sets up a match with rules, players and locations of their liking and simply plays.  One of the features of this part of the game is the choice whether to play during the day or night, however the option to play during the night must be unlocked. <br/> <br/><h3>Challenge Mode</h3>This mode is the \"campaign\" mode of the game and starts the player as Mario seeking to start his own baseball team. This is where the player will unlock new characters and stadiums for use in the game's other modes. The action is justified by a simplistic story in which Bowser is taking over baseball stadiums. <br/> <br/><h3>Toy Field  </h3>Players must hit the ball the a certain point on the field while other players attempt to catch it, if they are successful they become the batter. <br/> <br/><h3>Practice</h3>A standard practice mode where the player can get more used to the game and its mechanics.  <br/><br/><h3>Minigames</h3>The game contains nine minigames some of which must be unlocked as the player goes through the game.<br/> <br/><h2>Ball Parks</h2><h3> Peach Ice Garden</h3>The ice reflections are pretty, but the roving blocks of ice will freeze outfielders with just a touch! The minigame for this stadium is Wall Ball.<br/><br/><h3> Bowser Jr. Play Room</h3>After a win here in Challenge mode, Jr.'s room is replaced by a tougher stadium: Bowser Castle. You can play Graffiti Runner in this stadium. <br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/83448/1369347-bowser_pinball.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1369347\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/83448/1369347-bowser_pinball.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1369347\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83448/1369347-bowser_pinball.jpeg\"></a><figcaption>Bowser Pinball is played here at Bowser's Castle. </figcaption></figure> <h3>Bowser's Castle</h3>If you play this stadium at night, then <a data-ref-id=\"3005-337\" href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\" slug=\"bowser\"> Bowser</a> will greet him for a friendly game of baseball and if you're lucky enough to defeat his team, then you can try your hitting skills in Bowser Pinball.<br/><br/><h3> Toy Field</h3>A bonus game is played here: players take turns batting while everyone else tries to catch (and keep) the most coins by the end of the game.<br/><br/><h3> DK Jungle</h3>The DK crew is in full effect with a cool jungle stadium and a roster that includes Donkey, Diddy and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-303\" href=\"/dixie-kong/3005-303/\" slug=\"dixie-kong\"> DIxie Kong</a>.<br/><br/><h3> Wario City</h3>The grubby garlic-gobbler has a stage that is part Vegas and part carnival, and looks best at night when it's all lit up.

The game was also a commercial success, keeping a spot in the Top 5 of the NPD every month from its release on May 23, 2010 until the month of September 2010.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p style=\"\">The game begins with an invitation from <a href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-709\">Princess Peach</a> to meet her at the <a href=\"/mushroom-castle/3035-2556/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2556\">Mushroom Castle</a>.

When you complete a level as Luigi, a Ghost Luigi will appear representing the developer's \"speed run\" that players can race against for completion times or sometimes he will show you neat tricks and secrets. Once Bowser has been beaten in World 6, Luigi is unlocked and able to be used on every level of the game.</p><p style=\"\">Unlike in previous 3D Mario games, levels are not accessible through areas in the game's <a href=\"/hub-world/3015-1855/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1855\">hub world</a>. Instead, players navigate with a <a href=\"/\">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>-style map. This map is accessed via the wheel of Starship Mario, an explorable space containing NPCs and hidden power-ups. New levels on the map must be unlocked using Power Stars collected during levels. Coins and star bits can open secret areas on the map, while hidden Comet Medals are used to unlock more difficult challenges.</p><p style=\"\">If the levels are completed manually without the help of the <a href=\"/super-guide/3015-4045/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4045\">Cosmic Guide</a>, the player will earn <a href=\"/power-stars/3055-3898/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3898\">Power Star</a>s which are used to unlock more levels. If the player uses the help of the Cosmic Guide, they will only receive a Bronze Star, which aren't as useful as the Power Stars as they do not unlock more levels or worlds. Each world is completed by a battle with <a href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-337\">Bowser</a> or <a href=\"/bowser-jr/3005-825/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-825\">Bowser Jr.</a></p><h2>New Mario forms</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9589/1355198-smg05_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1355198\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9589/1355198-smg05_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1355198\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9589/1355198-smg05_1_.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Rock Mario</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Super Mario Galaxy 2 introduces Rock Mario, Drill Mario and Cloud Mario.</p><p style=\"\">You become Rock Mario by picking up a Rock Mushroom, you can then shake the remote to turn Mario into a rolling boulder, once set in motion he cannot be stopped until the rolling wears out after awhile or he hits a wall, he's not completly out of control though, players can still control the direction and making him jump.

What it does is when you spin the remote you can use one of the small clouds as a temporary platform. If you need to refill your clouds, you need to collect another Cloud flower. In addition to that, Cloud Mario is much more floaty or lighter than regular Mario, you fall slower and reach greater distance with long jumps etc. Taking hit or touching water makes you lose the power, you can bring it with you in Launch stars however.</p><h2>Yoshi</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27239/1283182-qe_vxf8gm1l7ezgiikp8l4in3l4x5qbb.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1283182\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27239/1283182-qe_vxf8gm1l7ezgiikp8l4in3l4x5qbb.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1283182\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27239/1283182-qe_vxf8gm1l7ezgiikp8l4in3l4x5qbb.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Yoshi in the game.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The original Super Mario Galaxy had a small Yoshi easter egg which resulted in many fans begging for his appearance in a future Mario game. Nintendo later added Yoshi in this game. He's trapped in a Yoshi egg in some Galaxies, Mario and Luigi can smack it open to free him, then they can ride him.</p><p style=\"\">He runs faster than the plumbers and are not effected by muddy surfaces that would slow down the player otherwise, his iconic move, the Flutter Jump makes a return, a move that really boost your airtime. Yoshi can also use his long tongue to gobble up fruits and enemies, eating enemies will turn them into Star Bits. Just aim on what you want to eat with the remote and press B, more huge objects requires you to hold B and move Yoshi away from it to drag it loose then eat it. (Example of this is Piranha Plants). You can also use his tongue to grab on floating flowers, which he then can use to swing to the other side.</p><p style=\"\">If you take a hit while on Yoshi, you're tossed off and Yoshi starts to runs around in panic, you have to jump back on or Spin nearby him to ride him again, left alone for too long and he returns to his egg. Falling into space or getting electrocuted will make Yoshi return to his egg immediately.</p><p style=\"\">As mentioned before, Yoshi can eat all kind of fruits in this game, and each one has a different effect on him.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/111937/1739052-mario_galaxy_2_yoshi_powers.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1739052\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/111937/1739052-mario_galaxy_2_yoshi_powers.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1739052\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/111937/1739052-mario_galaxy_2_yoshi_powers.png\"></a><figcaption>Yoshi's fruit powers</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>Red Berry</b>: All over the place in most Yoshi stages, you get Star Bits every time you eat one, eat ten to earn yourself a 1UP</li><li><b>Flotacius Blimp Fruit</b>: A blue, ballon like fruit, it turns Yoshi into a ballon which allows him and Mario to float up for a short time, you can hold \"A\" to stop rising, and shake the remote to cancel the move early.</li><li><b>Bulb Berry</b>: Found in dark areas, eating one will make a light zone around Yoshi for a limited time, invisible platforms and objects will become visible and useable if within this light zone.</li><li><b>Red Dash Pepper</b>: Eating one will set Yoshi's mouth on fire for awhile, in this state he can't stop running in great speed, you can still control his direction and jumps though.

In Galaxy 1 they appeared then disappeared later, it was also fairly random which stages it appeared on and their color told the player what the challenge would be. (Red ones meant speed run etc.) However in this game they're all yellow, they don't go away until completed on that stage and each comet needs a set number of Comet Medals to appear.</p><p style=\"\">This means the Prankster Comet challenges is a bit more unlimited this time around, some stages will have you to speed run, defeat all enemies before the time limit runs out or even complete whole stages with only one hit allowed.</p><h2>Navigation</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/100719/1429640-rightside_down_galaxy.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1429640\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/100719/1429640-rightside_down_galaxy.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1429640\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/100719/1429640-rightside_down_galaxy.png\"></a><figcaption>A new world map allows for quick navigation.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Galaxies consist of 49 \"get the star to win\" planets, stardust toll gates, star gates (which you need a certain amount of stars to pass through), boss planets, and bonus secret planets. The game has a total of 242 stars to collect in all; 120 normal stars, 120 green stars and in the last stage one Grand Star is available, the other Grand Star is unlockable.</p><p style=\"\">To get to new worlds, Starship Mario uses a wormhole to travel through hyperspace. The 'worlds' are visually represented as actual Galaxies, and you can point and click on a planet previously visited to jump straight to it, instead of physically taking Starship Mario there.</p><h2>Development</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3017/1043050-super_mario_galaxy_2_e3_2009_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1043050\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3017/1043050-super_mario_galaxy_2_e3_2009_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1043050\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3017/1043050-super_mario_galaxy_2_e3_2009_01.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Reveal at E3 2009</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Super Mario Galaxy 2 conceptually began life as a remixed version of the original Super Mario Galaxy with new elements added.

The new music they composed helped in moving the project from an expansion to a full blown sequel.</p><p style=\"\">The composers looked at the concept art for the game to come up with a feel for the music.

Although this would normally be extravagant, Miyamoto was fine with it because it was close by. Not everyone could fit in the hall at once, so they had to take shifts to watch the orchestra play.</p><blockquote><p style=\"\"><i>\"One of the designers said, \"We'll have to raise the bar for our picture quality much, much higher, so we don't lose out to this music!\", and some members who'd never say they were moved about anything said, \"Well, I was really moved\"</i>. <b>- Mahito Yokota, on the staff's reaction to the music</b></p></blockquote><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9589/1527016-0_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1527016\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9589/1527016-0_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1527016\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9589/1527016-0_1_.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Takemoto conducts the Super Mario Galaxy orchestra for the staff.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Koji Kondo created five pieces for the game, three of them being <a href=\"/yoshi-star-galaxy/3035-3016/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3016\">Yoshi Star Galaxy</a>, <a href=\"/marios-faceship/3055-3905/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3905\">Starship Mario</a>, and <a href=\"/bowser-jr/3005-825/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-825\">Bowser Jr.'s Fortress</a> theme. Starship Mario was written to be an opposite to New Super Mario Bros. Wii's World Map, to be a place for the player to calm down and rest in between levels, which had very active music.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Paper Mario: Sticker Star sees the first appearance of the <a href=\"/paper-mario/3025-460/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-460\">Paper Mario</a> series on the <a href=\"/nintendo-3ds/3045-117/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-117\">Nintendo 3DS</a>. The game eschews the real-time combat of <a href=\"/super-paper-mario/3030-12739/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12739\">Super Paper Mario</a>, returning to the turn-based combat system that defined earlier games in the series. It also introduces new gameplay mechanics including the titular stickers which <a href=\"/mario/3005-24521/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24521\">Mario</a> uses to attack enemies.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style=\"\">The story starts off in the <a href=\"/the-mushroom-kingdom/3035-14/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-14\">Mushroom Kingdom</a>, during the yearly Sticker Fest. An event much similar to the Renaissance Festival, except instead of artisans, people craft stickers which contain magical powers that come from the 3-D world around them. <a href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-337\">Bowser</a>, angry that he was not invited to the event, thinks it would be fun to play a prank on everyone during the festivities. But something goes wrong during Bowser's joke and Six Royal Stickers ended up becoming attached to Bowser and his minions, giving them new powers. It's up to Mario and a Sticker faerie named Kersti to set off and get the stickers and bring them back to the Mushroom Kingdom.</p><p style=\"\">Mario will travel to many new places, particularly new areas that deal with nature, such as snowy mountains and fiery volcanoes. As he retrieves the stickers he will gain new powers that he can use in combat and also to help him solve puzzles in the world around him. Eventually in the game Mario will even be able to create his own unique blend of stickers that can give players the certain edge they need.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">The gameplay mechanics have returned to its turned-based style and sidescrolling platformer-style from the first two games, leaving out the action adventure themes and 3D platforming from Super Paper Mario.</p><p style=\"\">Paper Mario: Sticker Star will have the Jump and Hammer commands just like the previous games, this time it will have a redesigned layout for the 3DS , as well as a proper party system, with Mario accompanied by a single \"partner\" at a time. Some screenshots show characters such as <a href=\"/chain-chomp/3015-2986/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2986\">Chain Chomp</a> or <a href=\"/\">Wiggler</a> will be used as partners, rather than them being replaced by <a href=\"http://www.mariowiki.com/Pixl\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pixls</a> in the previous installment. Another screen shot shows an outlined object, suggesting that players will be able to use the stylus to certain object`s around the area to solve puzzles.</p><p style=\"\">According to the Official Nintendo Magazine in Europe, stickers are a major part of the gameplay. These objects appear in the form of stickers, and they will also have the ability to give power ups to Mario, such as the Frog Suit. They will also help solve puzzles in certain situations. There will also be a new Battle Slot Machine mechanic very similar to the Bingo mechanic in <a href=\"/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/3030-7481/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7481\">Paper Mario: Thousand Year Door.</a></p><h2>Confirmed Characters</h2><p style=\"\">Here are some protagonists and enemies visually seen to appear in the game.</p><ul><li><a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Mario</a></li><li><a href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\">Luigi</a></li><li>Un-named <a href=\"/chain-chomp/3015-2986/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2986\">Chain Chomp</a></li><li>Un-named <a href=\"/wiggler/3015-2987/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2987\">Wiggler</a></li><li>Crowned <a href=\"/monty-mole/3005-3713/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3713\">Monty Mole</a></li></ul><h2>Confirmed Enemies</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/goomba/3015-2891/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2891\">Goombas</a></li><li><a href=\"/koopa/3015-120/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-120\">Red Koopa Troopa</a></li><li><a href=\"/koopa/3015-120/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-120\">Green Koopa Troopa</a></li><li><a href=\"/pokey/3015-2725/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2725\">Pokeys</a></li><li><a href=\"/whomp/3015-6058/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6058\">Whomps</a></li><li><a href=\"/wiggler/3015-2987/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2987\">Wigglers</a></li><li><a href=\"/monty-mole/3015-4294/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4294\">Monty Mole</a></li><li><a href=\"/bob-omb/3055-480/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-480\">Bob-omb</a></li><li><a href=\"/hammer-bros/3015-783/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-783\">Hammer Bros</a></li></ul><h2>Download Version</h2><p style=\"\">Block size: 4,199 blocks</p>",

It's the first portable 3D <a href=\"/mario/3025-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1\">Mario</a> game, not counting <a href=\"/super-mario-64-ds/3030-8942/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8942\">Super Mario 64 DS</a>, which was merely a remake, and marks the return of the popular <a href=\"/tanooki-suit/3055-38/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-38\">Tanooki Suit</a>, although its alternate ability--namely turning into a statue--is not available until halfway through the game when you first encounter silver leafs.</p><p style=\"\">The game was released in November 2011. As of April 2012, it has sold 5.84 million copies worldwide.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/121333/1807310-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1807310\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/121333/1807310-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1807310\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/121333/1807310-2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Avoiding Bullet-Bills on an enemy ship.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In the Nintendo <a href=\"/e3-2011/3015-6449/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6449\">E3 2011</a> press conference, a trailer for <i>Super Mario 3D Land</i> was shown. The gameplay is a combination of of <a href=\"/new-super-mario-bros/3030-8224/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8224\">New Super Mario Bros.</a> and <a href=\"/super-mario-galaxy/3025-1347/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1347\">Super Mario Galaxy</a>, and will feature many locked camera angles that can result in 2D and isometric gameplay. The game will feature Mario without a <a href=\"/super-mushroom/3055-49/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-49\">super mushroom</a>, Super Mario, and the Raccoon suit. In 2D Mario fashion, Mario will have to land on a flagpole to end a level.</p><p style=\"\">The levels shown in the E3 2011 show the usual plethora of Mario levels. There is a tropical level, sky level, <a href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-337\">Bowser</a> level, Egyptian level, clockwork level and an underground level. The demo also shows a stage that gives homage to the <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-9\">The Legend of Zelda</a> series with top down gameplay and classic Zelda Elements.</p><p style=\"\">The game features 8 worlds at first, but after defeating <a href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-337\">Bowser</a> in World 8, an additional 8 \"Special\" worlds become available which feature added gameplay elements such as the full Tanooki Suit and <a href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\">Luigi</a> as a playable character.</p><h2>Reveal</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/121333/1807318-5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1807318\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/121333/1807318-5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1807318\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/121333/1807318-5.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Boom-Booms from Mario 3 appear as bosses</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">A new Mario title for the Nintendo 3DS was announced by <a href=\"/satoru-iwata/3040-46955/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-46955\">Satoru Iwata</a> at <a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo's</a> GDC keynote on March 2, 2011. The game is being developed by the <a href=\"/nintendo-ead/3010-463/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-463\">Nintendo EAD</a> team responsible for the <a href=\"/super-mario-galaxy/3025-1347/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1347\">Super Mario Galaxy</a> series. At the GDC presentation, a \"Super Mario\" logo was displayed with a silhouette of a tail similar to that of a raccoon's, this hinted at the return of the Raccoon Suit power-up from <a href=\"/super-mario-bros-3/3030-10299/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10299\">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>.</p><p style=\"\">In addition to that there is something that resembles a <a href=\"/star-coin/3055-3137/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3137\">Star Coin</a> found in the New Mario Bros games or Comet Medal from the Galaxy games in one of the screenshots.</p><p style=\"\">Iwata also told the audience how they're working on how to solve design problems like how to help players hit the <a href=\"/mario-block/3055-702/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-702\">question blocks</a> even in if it is in 3D and not 2D while showing this game.</p><h2>Power Ups</h2><ul><li><b>Tanooki Suit:</b> A returning favorite from <a href=\"/super-mario-bros-3/3030-10299/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10299\">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>, the Tanooki suit allows Mario the ability to attack enemies by swinging his tail. It also grants the player the ability to float down by repeatedly pressing the jump button. The ability to turn into a statue is only available once the player has unlocked the special levels.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Golden Tanooki Suit:</b> Does everything that the regular Tanooki Suit can do with added bonus of making Mario completely impervious to all enemies and their attacks with the lone exception of falling of a platform to his death. Its effect lasts until Mario makes it through the level. Only appears after you've died a certain amount of times in certain levels.</li><li><b>Full Tanooki Suit:</b> Only appears in the secret worlds upon completion of the main game. This iteration of the Tanooki Suit replicates the \"true\" Tanooki Suit from Super Mario Bros. 3. In addition to floating, Mario can transform into a statue in order to protect himself from enemy attacks. The statue form can be activated by performing a ground pound, which also allows Mario to stomp on spiked enemies. The full Tanooki Suit power up appears as a silver leaf, and the suit sports a red (or Green if playing as Luigi) neckerchief.</li><li><b>Super Mushroom:</b> The original Super Mario power up. This makes Mario slightly bigger and protects him from instant death if it by an enemy or any of the hazards found in a level. Mario starts of in his big state by default and thus the Mushroom will only appear if Mario has taken a hit.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Boomerang Suit:</b> Similar to the Hammer Brother suit featured in Super Mario Bros. 3. This suit grants Mario the boomerang throwing abilities of the Boomerang Brother enemies in the game. Boomerangs can be used to grab far away coins and Star Coins</li></ul><ul><li><b>Starman:</b> A Mario classic. Starman makes Mario completely invincible to everything except falling to his death for a brief period of time.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Fire Flower:</b> A Super Mario staple. The Fire Flower grants Mario the ability to use fire balls to defeat enemies.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Propeller Block:</b> Functions similarly to the Propeller Suit in New Super Mario Bros.. When Mario grabs a hold of the block, he will be able to do a second jump in the air and use the block to float around for a short period of time.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Coin Block Mario:</b> Transforms Mario into a coin block. As Mario walks around with it he will acquire coins. Can be used in conjunction with whatever suit Mario is wearing when he picks up the coin block power up.</li></ul><h2>StreetPass Functionality</h2><ul><li><b>Question Mark Levels:</b> Most worlds feature a level which is shown on the top screen as a purple cube with question marks on each side. These levels contain <a href=\"/star-coin/3055-3137/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3137\">star coins</a> which can only be collected once. <a href=\"/streetpass-functionality/3015-6609/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6609\">StreetPass</a> allows for these levels to be replaced with different levels which will contain new star coins and may be more challenging.</li><li><b><a href=\"/toad/3005-845/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-845\">Toad</a>'s House:</b> Many worlds will have Toad's house as a level. These levels feature free power ups which will be replaced with more powerful ones by StreetPass. Each time you connect with a person, the power up linked to them will be more powerful. For example: on the first StreetPass with Person 1, a house will contain a Super Mushroom, on the second StreetPass with that same person, it may contain a Fire-Flower.</li><li><b><a href=\"/leaderboard/3015-30/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-30\">Leaderboards</a>:</b> After the special worlds are unlocked, leaderboards become available for each level. If you finish a level from start to end (without dying) your time will be recorded and will be displayed to others who have unlocked these levels. Your times are recorded from before the special worlds are unlocked, however you cannot view them until afterwards.</li></ul><h2>External Links</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.nintendo.co.jp/3ds/arej\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Official Japanese Website</a></li><li><a href=\"http://supermario3dland.nintendo.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Official North American Webiste</a></li></ul><h2>eShop Version</h2><p style=\"\">Size: 4,096 blocks (512 MB)</p>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">New Super Mario Bros. U is a <a href=\"/wii-u/3045-139/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-139\">Wii U</a> game developed and published by <a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a>. It was released on November 18, 2012. It is the fourth game in the <a href=\"/new-super-mario-bros/3025-1546/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1546\">New Super Mario Bros. franchise</a> and nearly the 200th game with a direct relation to the <a href=\"/mario/3025-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1\">Mario franchise</a>.</p><p style=\"\">New Super Mario Bros. U was revealed initially as New Super Mario Bros. Mii, a demo \"experience\" during the unveiling of the Wii U at <a href=\"/e3-2011/3015-6449/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6449\">E3 2011</a> and was never confirmed to be an actual game. Later in the year, <a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a> announced that it was indeed a full title that would be shown again at <a href=\"/e3-2012/3015-7024/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7024\">E3 2012</a> as the new Mario game for the Wii U.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style=\"\">In New Super Mario Bros. U, Bowser takes over Princess Peach's castle, throwing Mario, Luigi and the toads to the far edge of the Mushroom Kingdom. Mario and Co. must work their way back towards the castle, defeating the Koopalings, Bowser Jr. and many other enemies along the way.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3830/2378769-nsmbumushroomkingdom.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2378769\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3830/2378769-nsmbumushroomkingdom.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2378769\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3830/2378769-nsmbumushroomkingdom.png\"></a><figcaption>Mario and Co. have complete freedom to move about each world.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Gameplay is similar to other Mario platforms, with it's closest relation being to that of <a href=\"/new-super-mario-bros-wii/3030-26841/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26841\">New Super Mario Bros Wii</a>. The game features an enhanced <a href=\"/cooperative-play/3015-108/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-108\">four-player cooperative mode</a> which integrates the <a href=\"/off-tv-play/3015-7482/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7482\">GamePad</a> as the user can create platforms to help collect items for other players. A new squirrel suit (triggered by an Super Acorn) has been added, which lets Mario glide. The game also refers to fan-favorite Super Mario World with its world-map design. The map features multiple branching paths that can be freely chosen, with the ability to explore at all times and does not feature segmented levels like previous games in the New Super Mario Bros. franchise.</p><p style=\"\">When playing as one player, either a Wii Remote or the GamePad can play through the entire game. The GamePad allows for off-TV play, however the Boost Mode will only work if the first player uses a Wii Remote.</p><p style=\"\">If a player loses a life or presses \"A\" on their Wii Remote during a multiplayer session, they will be trapped in a bubble and can only be freed by other players or from the Boost Mode player by simply tapping on them. If all players lose a life/get trapped in a bubble, or if a player in a Single Player game loses a life, the player(s) are sent back to the world map.</p><p style=\"\">Other multiplayer functions include the ability to carry and throw other players which have additional benefits. This can allow for others to jump atop to gain extra height or if one player with a Starman power grabs another player, they can then share the power-up. If all players on screen perform a ground pound at the same time, this performs a Double Ground Pound that defeats all enemies on screen.</p><p style=\"\">When viewing the touch screen during Boost Mode, the GamePad player can also stop obstacles or startle enemies. The tablet can also showcase blocks that can be revealed, such as blocks with a Crescent Moon symbol that act as a regular block which rewards Cresent Moon items. When collected, they provide three 1-Ups. If players hop on 10 Boost Blocks consecutively, a Boost Star will appear for the Boost Mode player to tap. This grants the Boost Mode player the ability to tap on enemies to defeat them.</p><h3>Playable Characters</h3><p style=\"\">Like <a href=\"/new-super-mario-bros-wii/3030-26841/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26841\">New Super Mario Bros. Wii</a>, the game features <a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Mario</a> and <a href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\">Luigi</a>, as well as Blue and Yellow <a href=\"/toads/3015-3369/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3369\">Toads</a> as playable characters in all modes. Players can also opt to play as their <a href=\"/mii-support/3015-270/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-270\">Mii</a> in Boost Rush, Challenge Mode and Coin Battle. Mario is always the first player during the story mode.</p><h3>Power-Ups</h3><p style=\"\">Almost all of the <a href=\"/power-up/3015-700/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-700\">power-ups</a> from New Super Mario Bros. Wii return in this incarnation (only the <a href=\"/propeller-mushroom/3055-3057/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3057\">Propeller Mushroom</a> does not make an appearance). The <a href=\"/penguin-suit/3055-3056/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3056\">Penguin Suit</a> is exclusive to Challenge Mode.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2227551-newsupermariobrosu8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2227551\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2227551-newsupermariobrosu8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2227551\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/135472/2227551-newsupermariobrosu8.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Super Squirrel Squad</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">New to the game is the Super Acorn, an object that will grant the <a href=\"/flying-squirrel/3015-4602/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4602\">Flying Squirrel</a> Suit. This form is similar to past games' flying/gliding powers, such as <a href=\"/super-leaf/3055-3909/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3909\">Raccoon Mario</a> and <a href=\"/feather-cape/3055-525/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-525\">Cape Mario</a>, but also allows clinging to certain surfaces, and an additional <a href=\"/double-jump/3015-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1\">air jump</a> whilst gliding by shaking the Gamepad or Wii Remote.</p><p style=\"\">The P-Acorn is a special variety of Super Acorn that allows continuous flight by allowing you to shake the Gamepad or Wii Remote to gain height, similar to the <a href=\"/p-wing/3055-4364/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4364\">P-Wings</a> of older games.</p><p style=\"\"><a href=\"/yoshi/3005-700/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-700\">Yoshi</a> makes a return in certain levels. Players can hop on Yoshi, eat enemies and flutter jump to reach new heights. Yoshi will also eat berries that hang from bushes within levels. Eating five berries causes Yoshi to lay an egg that hatches an item.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3830/2378772-toad_and_blue_baby_yoshi.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2378772\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3830/2378772-toad_and_blue_baby_yoshi.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2378772\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3830/2378772-toad_and_blue_baby_yoshi.png\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">Baby Yoshi also returns from Super Mario World. However there are now several colored Baby Yoshis with specific powers that will accompany the players should they run into a Baby Yoshi on the World map. Magenta Baby Yoshis will cause it to balloon up and allow the player to float in the air by shaking the controller. You will gain addition height so long as Baby Yoshi has air left within it. Blue Baby Yoshis will spit bubbles that will trap enemies, turning them into coins. Finally Yellow Baby Yoshis emit light once shaken. This can be used to startle enemies by shining bright light in their faces, leaving them vulnerable to attack.</p><p style=\"\">Once a level is completed, Yoshi and Yellow Baby Yoshi will stay behind, with Yellow Baby Yoshi providing the players with a 1-Up. Magenta and Blue Baby Yoshis may be carried over into other levels however.</p><h3>Miiverse</h3><p style=\"\"><a href=\"/miiverse/3015-7470/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7470\">Miiverse</a> functionality provides players the chance to post a response or an image on a level via a prompt that will appear if players do not take damage, lose several lives, collect all three star coins or other several conditions after completing a level. The game will also show balloons with Mii faces showcasing select Miiverse posts. If the Wii U console is offline, this feature will not work.</p><h2>Game Modes</h2><h3>Story Mode</h3><p style=\"\">Play through eight worlds and rescue the princess. Player one must play as Mario, while the other players can select Luigi, Blue Toad or Yellow Toad.</p><h3>Challenges</h3><p style=\"\">Complete a level that features specific conditions such as surviving for a period of time, finishing a level quickly and more. A replay of your best efforts are saved once a challenge is completed that can be viewed any time. This mode can only be played with at least two people, with one player on the GamePad</p><h3>Boost Rush</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/26317/1806007-wiiu_mario_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1806007\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/26317/1806007-wiiu_mario_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1806007\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/26317/1806007-wiiu_mario_5.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Mii characters are playable during the special game modes.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Players will run through a select group of levels with the goal is to complete the group of levels in the shortest time possible. The screen will automatically scroll to the right and will scroll faster based on how many coins are collected.

In this prequel to the other <a href=\"/mario/3025-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1\">Mario titles</a>, players no longer control Mario; instead, they control Mario's green side-kick, <a href=\"/yoshi/3005-700/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-700\">Yoshi</a>. Mario himself is in the game and always with Yoshi, but it's not the plumber that players had grown used to; instead Mario returns as a baby, riding on Yoshi's back as Yoshi journeys through various levels on his way to Baby <a href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-337\">Bowser</a>'s castle to save Mario's brother <a href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\">Luigi</a>. Not only did this represent a major shift for the Super Mario series, it also marked a shift in visual design as well. Yoshi's Island used much more colorful palettes than other titles and appears much more stylized. Most objects and environments have much bolder lines and larger contrasts in colors, which gives itself a much more artistic, childish, and hand-drawn feel. Yoshi's Island was originally released on the <a href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">Super Nintendo.</a></p><p style=\"\">In 2002, Yoshi's Island was re-released on the <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a> under the name Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3. Yoshi's Island received its first sequel in 2006 on the <a href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">Nintendo DS</a>, titled <a href=\"/yoshis-island-ds/3030-10347/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10347\">Yoshi's Island DS</a>. The story was a follow up to Yoshi's Island, though not a direct sequel, and not nearly as well received.</p><p style=\"\">There are 6 different worlds in Yoshi's Island, each one with a different theme. World 1 is a field theme, World 2 has a forest theme, World 3 is a jungle, World 4 contains a variety of themes, World 5 has a snowy theme, and World 6 has a dystopic theme. World 6 is the final area of the game, where Yoshi faces off against <a href=\"/kamek/3005-1227/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1227\">Kamek</a> and <a href=\"/baby-bowser/3005-4566/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4566\">young Bowser.</a></p><p style=\"\">Yoshi's Island was the first major Mario title that did not contain any form of a warp zone, allowing players to transport themselves further into the game. To complete Yoshi's Island, players were required to complete all of the game's 48 regular stages, though getting 100% completion was a much more daunting task with the many bonus levels featured in the title.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6246/301504-yoshi4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-301504\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6246/301504-yoshi4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-301504\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6246/301504-yoshi4.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The story begins</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Our tale begins as a stork carries two peaceful young children over the tranquil ocean. All seems well, however, danger rears its ugly head as the evil magikoopa Kamek arrives, swiping Baby Luigi. He attempts to kidnap both infants, but fails, leaving baby Mario to plummet down into the ocean. Mario falls towards a small island in the great expanse of water, home of the Yoshis, an island called Yoshi's Island. Luckily for our young friend, he lands safely on the back of a bright green yoshi. Mario somehow makes Yoshi and his multi-colored friends aware of the catastrophe, and the entire tribe of dinosaurs enlists in the fight. Together, these yoshis will in turn carry Mario through dangerous terrain and, against all odds, rescue Baby Luigi and defeat Kamek. This is exactly what happens, as well. After a long, perilous journey across Yoshi's island's most threatening terrain whilst being pursued by Baby Bowser's minions, the Yoshi's arrive at Baby Bowser's castle. They fight with great strenght against both Bowser and Kamek, and come out the victors. Baby Mario and Luigi are both safe, and all is well in the world.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6246/301508-yoshi7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-301508\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6246/301508-yoshi7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-301508\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6246/301508-yoshi7.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Yoshi scrambling to get baby Mario back.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Yoshi's Island introduces a plethora of new moves for Yoshi now that he has become the main character. Many of the moves that he has since become known for were first developed in this title, including his ability to hover by kicking his feet furiously for a few seconds. Yoshi's ability to create <a href=\"/yoshi-egg/3055-588/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-588\">eggs</a> from enemies and then use them as weapons was also introduced in this title. Throughout his adventures, Yoshi can accumulate up to six eggs that can be used to reach far off switches and collectibles or to simply eliminate enemies. Occasionally, players will have to get keys or other objects that will replace an egg in the line up following Yoshi</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4231/967278-yoshi_s_island__v1.1___u__0005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-967278\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4231/967278-yoshi_s_island__v1.1___u__0005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-967278\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4231/967278-yoshi_s_island__v1.1___u__0005.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Shooting your eggs.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">to unlock or advance in a level. Unlike other Mario titles, Yoshi does not have a finite amount of health (he can be killed instantly by pits, lava, spikes and other such hazards though). Instead, players will have to rescue Baby Mario within a certain time-limit whenever Yoshi is hit. Throughout a level, the timer will refill back to the default 10 seconds, but a player can collect objects, such as bouncing starmen (not to be confused with ones from other Super Mario titles that provide invulnerability), that will increase the limit up to 30 seconds.</p><p style=\"\">Hidden throughout each level are a number of extras which players can collect. Part of the challenge of each level includes collecting these items, which are red coins and flowers. Each level has 20 red coins and 5 flowers. Tthe red coins simply serve as a collectible, but the flowers give the player an increased chance of playing a mini-game once they complete the level. If a player collects all of the items in a level and finishes with 30 seconds on their timer, they receive a perfect score of 100 for that level.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4231/967282-yoshi_s_island__v1.1___u__0009.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-967282\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4231/967282-yoshi_s_island__v1.1___u__0009.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-967282\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4231/967282-yoshi_s_island__v1.1___u__0009.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">Some levels require Yoshi to collect a transformation power-up that transforms Yoshi into a vehicle for a limited amount of time. Yoshi can become a helicopter, letting him fly; a car, which increases his speed, but he must avoid enemies; a submarine, which lets him shoot torpedoes that home onto enemies; a train, which rides on rails, but must avoid other enemies also on the tracks; and a mole vehicle that can dig through certain obstacles. During any vehicle segment, players don't have to worry about losing Baby Mario, but still must complete the segment before the transformation wears off. When a player successfully reaches the end of the segment, Yoshi and Baby Mario are reunited and the level continues.</p><p style=\"\">On a few rare occasions, Yoshi has a chance to nab a \"super star,\" altering Baby Mario into the 'Super Baby Mario' form, also causing Mario to don a cape. This marks a turn of events for the game where the player controls Baby Mario rather then his scaly chauffer. Baby Mario can run at the speed of light up walls and across ceilings and has an improved ability to jump and glide. Many times, Mario can nab hard-to-reach items and plenty of coins. This power up is seldom seen, and only lasts for a very short period of time, so make good use of it.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5891/280138-super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island_snes_screenshot4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-280138\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5891/280138-super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island_snes_screenshot4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-280138\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5891/280138-super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island_snes_screenshot4.jpg\"></a><figcaption>A stage map where players pick the level they wish to play.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">At the end of each level, players jump through a goal hoop that will randomly reward the player with a mini-game. After that, players are scored out of 100 points depending on how many red coins they collected, how many of the five hidden flowers they found throughout the stage (which will also improve your chance of entering a mini-game) and how much time is left on the countdown timer. After the player receives their score, the Yoshi carrying Baby Mario hands him off to the next Yoshi that will carry Baby Mario through the next level. There six worlds altogether, each of which consists of eight levels that players must clear in order. Players can also unlock hidden bonus stages that add an extra challenge. Players can pick any stage they've previously beaten, in an attempt to get a better score or find any other hidden secrets. Each world has two castle areas where players have to face off against a boss which all have different weaknesses players must discover and are not necessarily as \"generic\" as the bosses seen in other Mario titles that all have similar weaknesses.</p><h3>Extra Stages</h3><p style=\"\">The extra stages are a series of optional stages that can be accessed if the player reaches a standard of points in specific worlds. Perfect scores are not required, however, the standards are not easy, and so a high score is required for most levels in a world. The extra stages prove to be much more challenging then the main stages throughout the game, only the elite could conquer a few of these stages.</p><p style=\"\">These stages are:</p><ul><li>Extra 1: Poochy aint Stupid</li><li>Extra 2: Hit that switch!!</li><li>Extra 3: More Monkey Madness</li><li>Extra 4: The Impossible? Maze</li><li>Extra 5: Kamek's Revenge</li><li>Extra 6: Castles - Masterpiece set</li></ul><h3>Mini Games</h3><p style=\"\">On every level, the player has a chance to play one of many mini-games. Some stages only allow access to mini-games through the end of stage roulette, however, there are special doors on some levels that give access</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7539/519081-yoshi_s_island___super_mario_world_2063.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-519081\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7539/519081-yoshi_s_island___super_mario_world_2063.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-519081\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7539/519081-yoshi_s_island___super_mario_world_2063.png\"></a><figcaption>A bonus challenge</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">to games. Certain levels will have small hut like buildings with locked doors. If the player can locate the key to the door, they can go inside and participate in a mini-game. These mini-games can provide the player with bonuses if they are successful.</p><p style=\"\"><i>Throwing Balloons</i>: In this mini-game, Yoshi and the bandit will toss a balloon to each other across the screen. As they toss the balloon, it will continue to grow larger and larger. Once it gets so big that it pops, the character holding it loses.</p><p style=\"\"><i>Popping Balloons</i>: popping balloons has Yoshi competing against the bandit to see who can pop the right balloon. The characters run across the small level, ground-pounding all of the balloons. Whoever pops the correct balloon is the winner.</p><p style=\"\"><i>Gather Coins</i>: Once again, Yosih is pitted against the bandit. This game has a cannon which moves across the screen, and shooting out coins into the air as it moves. The player must try and collect as many coins as possible. Once the game is over, the character with the most coins wins.</p><p style=\"\"><i>Watermelon Seed Spitting Contest</i>: This game puts Yoshi in combat against the bandit, both wielding watermelon seeds. Pots are scattered across the screen, each one with a watermelon in it. The characters collect the watermelons and eat them, then, as if they were a machine gun, spit out the seeds at eachother. Both characters have life, and whoever loses all of their life first is the loser.</p><h2>Game Boy Advance version</h2><p style=\"\">On September 22, 2002, Nintendo released the GBA port of Yoshi's island, titled Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshi's Island. Essentially, the games were identical aside from the obvious change in resolution. Nintendo added voice samples from the Nintendo 64 game Yoshi's Story, and changed the music in the GBA version of the game.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6246/301507-yoshi6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-301507\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6246/301507-yoshi6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-301507\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6246/301507-yoshi6.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Yoshi fighting Bowser off in the distance.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">One major change to the game was the addition of six new \"secret levels\" that a player could unlock once they had completed the game. These secret levels are completely seperate from the extra levels found in the SNES version, though those levels are also present in the port. In order to get these levels, players were required to obtain a score of 100 on all of the games 60 levels by collecting all that can be found on each level. Once they have these scores and have defeated bowser, a yellow box will appear on the level select menu with the word \"secret\" in it.</p><p style=\"\">The secret levels are as follows:</p><ul><li>Secret Level 1: Exercise in the Skies</li><li>Secret Level 2: Mystery of the Castle?</li><li>Secret Level 3: Go! Go!

In Extra level 3, 'More Monkey Madness,' a single red coin was removed taking the total on the level from 21 to 20.</p><p style=\"\">The GBA version of Yoshi's Island also featured a remake of the classic arcade game Mario Bros., as did other game boy advance Mario ports. Yoshi's Island was the first of the Mario advance series to allow players to put the game boy into a 'sleep' mode, which allowed them to put the game boy into powersave at any time without losing progress.</p><h2>Game Credits</h2><ul><li>Executive Producer - <a href=\"/hiroshi-yamauchi/3040-615/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-615\">Hiroshi Yamauchi</a></li><li>Producer - <a href=\"/shigeru-miyamoto/3040-614/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-614\">Shigeru Miyamoto</a></li><li>Director - <a href=\"/takashi-tezuka/3040-593/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-593\">Takashi Tezuka</a></li><li>Director - <a href=\"/toshihiko-nakago/3040-596/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-596\">Toshihiko Nakago</a></li><li>Director - <a href=\"/shigefumi-hino/3040-605/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-605\">Shigefumi Hino</a></li><li>Director - <a href=\"/hideki-konno/3040-594/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-594\">Hideki Konno</a></li><li>Chief Programmer - <a href=\"/toshio-iwawaki/3040-597/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-597\">Toshio Iwawaki</a></li><li>Main Programmer - <a href=\"/masaru-nii/3040-38760/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-38760\">Masaru Nii</a></li><li>Main Programmer - Kiyoshi Koda</li><li>Main Programmer - <a href=\"/satoru-takahata/3040-604/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-604\">Satoru Takahata</a></li><li>Main Programmer - <a href=\"/kazuaki-morita/3040-598/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-598\">Kazuaki Morita</a></li><li>Main Programmer - <a href=\"/yuichi-yamamoto/3040-38750/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-38750\">Yuichi Yamamoto</a></li><li>Main Programmer - <a href=\"/yasunori-taketani/3040-58562/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-58562\">Yasunori Taketani</a></li><li>Course - Level Design - <a href=\"/yasuhisa-yamamura/3040-38707/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-38707\">Yasuhisa Yamamura</a></li><li>Course - Level Design - <a href=\"/kenta-usui/3040-38708/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-38708\">Kenta Usui</a></li><li>Course - Level Design - <a href=\"/yoshihiro-nomoto/3040-602/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-602\">Yoshihiro Nomoto</a></li><li>Course - Level Design - <a href=\"/eiji-noto/3040-603/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-603\">Eiji Noto</a></li><li>Character Design <a href=\"/shigefumi-hino/3040-605/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-605\">Shigefumi Hino</a></li><li>Character Design - <a href=\"/hisashi-nogami/3040-38723/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-38723\">Hisashi Nogami</a></li><li>Character Design - Masahiro Iimura</li><li>Character Design - <a href=\"/tomoaki-kuroume/3040-38725/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-38725\">Tomoaki Kuroume</a></li><li>Graphic Design - <a href=\"/yoshiaki-koizumi/3040-38701/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-38701\">Yoshiaki Koizumi</a></li><li>Sound Composition - <a href=\"/koji-kondo/3040-606/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-606\">Koji Kondo</a></li><li>Technical Support - <a href=\"/takao-sawano/3040-38717/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-38717\">Takao Sawano</a></li><li>Map Director - Hidequi Konno</li><li>Area Director - <a href=\"/katsuya-eguchi/3040-595/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-595\">Katsuya Eguchi</a></li><li>Program Director - <a href=\"/toshihiko-nakago/3040-596/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-596\">Toshihiko Nakago</a></li><li>Main Programmer - <a href=\"/shigeki-yoshida/3040-38946/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-38946\">Shigeki Yoshida</a></li></ul>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2> <i>Hotel Mario</i> was released on the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-27\" href=\"/cd-i/3045-27/\" slug=\"cd-i\">                   Phillips CD-i</a> system in 1994. The primary goal of the game is to go through each of the seven hotels and defeat <a data-ref-id=\"3005-337\" href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\" slug=\"bowser\">                 Bowser</a>'s seven children and finally confront Bowser himself to rescue <a data-ref-id=\"3005-709\" href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709/\" slug=\"princess-peach\">                  Princess Peach</a> (who in the manual of the game is referred to as Princess Toadstool). <br/><br/>This is unique among Mario games because instead of the usual platforming <a data-ref-id=\"3005-177\" href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" slug=\"mario\">                Mario</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-370\" href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" slug=\"luigi\">               Luigi</a> make their way through seven hotels, closing all the doors on each of ten stages, with the exception of Bowser's hotel which has 15 stages. Closing all of the doors on a particular stage causes all of the enemies onscreen to die instantly and allows the player to proceed to the next level.   At the end of each hotel, Mario faces off against one of the Koopalings in a dramatic door battle.  As per the norm in this game, the only way for Mario to defeat the dreaded Koopa spawn is to close all of the doors.  Conversely, the Koopaling is competing to open all of the doors; if he succeeds, Mario is instantly killed. <br/><br/>The game has gained fame not for being great, but for being one of the worst Mario games ever produced and even <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" slug=\"nintendo\">            Nintendo</a> refuses to acknowledge that it exists.

Mario and Luigi don't even notice Bowser and they continue to walk towards the entrance to the Mushroom Kingdom and Mario notices a note on the entrance and picks it up. Mario reads the letter and finds out that Bowser has yet again taken over the Mushroom Kingdom and it's up to our heroic plumbers to stop him and his children as well. Eventually Mario and Luigi find the hotel where Bowser resides and finally rescue Princess Peach and the hotel where Bowser was explodes and the Princess <a data-ref-id=\"3015-138\" href=\"/breaking-the-fourth-wall/3015-138/\" slug=\"breaking-the-fourth-wall\">       breaks the fourth wall</a> and thanks you as the player for helping the Mario Bros as well and gives Mario and Luigi a kiss and they walk happily on a path back to the castle.<br/><br/><h2>Stages</h2><br/><b>Morton's WoodDoor-Hysteria</b><br/>It's a hotel built inside of a huge tree.<br/> <br/><b>Roy's HardBrick Hotel</b><br/>A hotel as the name implies is a hotel made of bricks, the lights flick off and on because of a room with too many toasters.<br/>   <br/><b>Larry's Chillton Hotel</b><br/>A hotel that resides within a cave and it is actually an ice cave.<br/>    <br/><b>Lemmy's High-ate Regency Hotel</b><br/>A hotel that is built in the sky and strangely has a giant fan outside of where it is.<br/><br/><b>Ludwig's Thump Castle Hotel</b><br/>A hotel with a horror based theme.<br/>     <br/><b>Wendy's Blitz Snarlton Hotel</b><br/>A hotel with a casino theme to it and it's one of the only hotels that actually resembles a true hotel.<br/>    <br/><b>Bowser's Seizures Palace Hotel</b> <br/>The last hotel that resembles Bowser's castle.<br/><br/><h2>Development History</h2>Back in 1991 Phillips was contacted by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" slug=\"nintendo\">      Nintendo</a> to help them make a CD based attachment for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-9\" href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" slug=\"snes\">     SNES</a>, but after delays Nintendo dropped the deal and when with <a data-ref-id=\"3010-3223\" href=\"/sony-corporation/3010-3223/\" slug=\"sony-corporation\">    Sony</a>, but Phillips had acquired the rights to produce Nintendo based games on their system the CD-I and so Hotel Mario was developed in a few years and released, but to poor reviews and sales due to the lack of people who could afford the CD-I. The game was also given cutscenes that were voiced by Mark Graue and not <a data-ref-id=\"3040-89571\" href=\"/charles-martinet/3040-89571/\" slug=\"charles-martinet\">   Charles Martinet</a>. The cut scenes depicted Mario and Luigi discussing with each other about who to do next and giving hints to the players on how to beat the next hotels. The art style of Hotel Mario was heavily based on Disney cartoons and also drew certain elements from JRR Tolkien's <a data-ref-id=\"3025-481\" href=\"/lord-of-the-rings/3025-481/\" slug=\"lord-of-the-rings\"> <i>Lord of the Rings</i></a> books.

It was released for the Game Boy Advance on January 13, 2005 in Japan, on March 28, 2005 in North America, and on June 10, 2005 in Europe. The game was developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-419\" href=\"/hudson-entertainment-inc/3010-419/\" slug=\"hudson-entertainment-inc\">Hudson Soft</a> and published by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" slug=\"nintendo\">Nintendo</a>. Due to the limited memory on a Game Boy Advance cartridge, the gameplay of Mario Party Advance differs from the Nintendo 64 and Nintendo GameCube iterations. The game takes place in Shroom City, where the goal is to collect all of the minigames and Gaddgets that were scattered by <a data-ref-id=\"3005-337\" href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\" slug=\"bowser\">Bowser</a>. Mario Party Advance was met with generally low reception, with the Metacritic average at 54%.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">Due to the limitations of the Game Boy Advance, there are far fewer playable characters than there were in previous Mario Party games.

Other non-playable characters include Shroomlock (a renowned detective), Mr. E (a mystery-lover), Mushbert (a fan of Toad Force V), and Mrs. Shroomlock (Shroomlock's wife).</p><p style=\"\">Mario Party Advance plays similarly to other Mario Party games, but due to it being on a</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/199784-1195689625_00.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-199784\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/199784-1195689625_00.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-199784\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/775/199784-1195689625_00.png\"></a><figcaption>Mario Party Advance Screen</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">handheld system, it does have differences. The game no longer has a four-player multiplayer mode that has been in almost all Mario Party games.

Gaddgets can be gathered by completing one of the game's many quests in the Shroom City mode, playing a Koopa Kid minigame, or purchasing one in the Challenge Land mode.

Players first choose from 3 classes they wish to race in–50cc, 100cc, or 150cc. Class determines the speed and aggressiveness of the enemy karts. The player can choose from eight characters with five unlockable characters becoming available as the game progresses. Each of the eight different cups consists of four races giving 32 tracks in total–16 brand new ones and 16 that have been taken from each of the four previous games. Depending on where a player finishes in a cup they will be given a rating of E, D, C, B, A or 1, 2, or 3 stars, with E being the worst and 3 stars the best. The action takes place on the top screen of the DS, whilst the bottom screen shows a map of the circuit and where each of the racers are. Touching the screen toggles between a map of the track and a close up of the player which also shows item boxes, course hazards and incoming weapon attacks.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1220189-mkds_03.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1220189\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1220189-mkds_03.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1220189\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/1220189-mkds_03.png\"></a><figcaption>The first race is about to start.

The player will want to pick up a power up pretty quickly by driving into a multi-colored <a data-ref-id=\"3055-718\" href=\"/item-box/3055-718/\" slug=\"item-box\">item box</a> which will give the driver a randomly selected item. When a player is in front these items are usually less powerful such as a banana skin that can be dropped behind you for other cars to skid on or a green shell which is a projectile weapon which requires manual targeting. At the back of the pack players get more exciting weapons like an invincibility star which increases the speed of your kart or a red shell which is a projectile weapon that will home in on the car in front of you causing them to spin out. Racers at the back will also get to use the dreaded Blue Shell which seeks out the first position driver and takes them out.</p><p style=\"\">Players can corner more effectively by power sliding around corners. Pressing one of the shoulder buttons when going around corners will put the kart to a skid and blue sparks will spit out the sides of the wheels. A player can then push left/right repeatedly on the d-pad which will make the sparks turn orange and the player will then get a small speed boost when they release the shoulder button. There are multi-colored strips scattered around each course that provide a further burst of speed when driven over. A new way a player can get a burst of speed is by drafting behind another player, after a few seconds blue lines will appear around the player which indicates a burst of speed and the player can power past the person in front–maybe barging them out the way as well if you are one of the stronger characters like Bowser or <a data-ref-id=\"3005-299\" href=\"/donkey-kong/3005-299/\" slug=\"donkey-kong\">Donkey Kong</a>. After each race, there is a scoring distribution for the eight racers. The winner of the race gets ten points, second place gives the player 8 points, six for third, and so on. After all four races, the three best drivers with the highest scores will receive trophies at the award ceremony. Bronze for third place, silver for second place, and a gold trophy for the winner of the cup.</p><h3>Time Trial</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1359/363050-wario_ds.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-363050\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1359/363050-wario_ds.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-363050\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1359/363050-wario_ds.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Mario Circuit 1 makes a welcome return.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Players can race on any of the 32 tracks and post their best lap times and total times overall. Some tracks will give the player a certain amount of mushroom power ups that give a burst of speed when used. On the bottom screen there is the map which shows the racing line that a player takes through the course which allows the player to see how he took a corner of a previous lap. You can save up to 32 ghost characters of your fastest times (one for each track) and you can also download ghost laps from friends. If you go fast enough on a track you will unlock and compete against a staff ghost which is a ghost time of a member of Nintendo staff.</p><h3>\"Vs.\"</h3><p style=\"\">Players can select from any of the 32 courses and choose options such as class, computer difficulty, whether to race as part of a team and whether they want to race a certain amount of races or just race until you get a certain amount of wins. During the race carts will have a tag attached to them showing an emblem.</p><h2>Modes</h2><p style=\"\">This is the first Mario Kart that has a one player battle mode. There are two different modes:</p><h3>Balloon Attack</h3><p style=\"\">In Balloon Attack, players square off against up to seven other computer controlled players in one of six arenas. Players try to burst opponents three balloons that are attached to their karts by collecting power ups and firing them into them or by ramming them when getting a burst of speed from a mushroom power up. Players start with only one balloon but can blow up four more balloons by blowing into the microphone on the DS or by holding down the select button if you want to be more discrete. The last man standing wins. This mode is also available in local ad hoc mode against up to seven other players using just one cartridge.</p><h3>Shine Runners</h3><p style=\"\">In Shine runners players compete against up to seven other computer controlled players in one of six arenas. Players try to collect the most shine sprites scattered throughout the level. You can steel sprites from your opponents by hitting them with power up items or by bashing into them. Players with the least amount of shines are slowly eliminated after set periods of time until the last man is left standing (60 seconds for the first round, and 30 for subsequent rounds). This mode is also available in local ad hoc mode against up to seven other players using just one cartridge.</p><h3>Missions</h3><p style=\"\">This is a brand new mode for the Mario Kart series. The mode consists of six different levels with a secret seven level unlockable on completion of the previous levels. Each level consists of eight different missions and a ninth boss mission. Players will take control of a specified character and kart and complete objectives such as collecting a certain amount of coins, drive through numbered gates in order, destroy item boxes or perform a certain number of power slides in a given number of laps. Players are rated according to how quickly they complete the tasks and similarly to the Grand Prix mode, are given a rating of E, D, C, B, A or 1, 2, or 3 stars, with E being the worst and 3 stars the best. When all missions of a level are completed, you will face off against a boss character which generally involves defeating a boss by firing projectiles at them or ramming them with a speed boost.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1359/362975-dk_race.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-362975\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1359/362975-dk_race.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-362975\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1359/362975-dk_race.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Donky Kong has a lot of catching up to do!</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">You can compete against up to seven other players in local ad hoc mode in a series of races on all 32 tracks. You can also play either of the two battle modes. The game supports DS download play, so if only one of a group of DS owning friends has a copy of the game you can all still play against each other but with only a few of the circuits and characters available. If you all own a copy of the game, all of the tracks and karts are available to choose from. This is the first Mario Kart game that can be played against other people over the internet. The Nintendo friend code system is used so if you want to play against a friend online you will need to have each others friend codes. You can choose any of the karts and characters you have unlocked in the single player modes and 20 of the 32 tracks. You race against up to three other randomly selected players and track selection is made by a voting system. If each player chooses a different track to race on then the game makes a random selection from the four tracks voted for. You can choose to play against people from all over the world or people from just your own continent. You can also choose to play against rivals, who are people with a similar win/loss record as you.</p><h2>Power Ups</h2><h3>Red Shell</h3><p style=\"\">A projectile weapon that seeks out the racer in front of them and makes them spin out and slow down. Can be held behind the kart to protect against incoming projectiles.</p><h3>Red Shell x3</h3><p style=\"\">Like the Red shell but you get 3 at once that spin around your kart and can be fired individually. If an opponent barges into you while you have 3 shells they will spin out and slow down.</p><h3>Green Shell</h3><p style=\"\">A projectile weapon that requires manual aiming and makes the target spin out and slow down. Can be held behind the kart to protect against incoming projectiles. Can also be fired behind by holding down on the d-pad while firing.</p><h3>Green Shell x3</h3><p style=\"\">Like the Green shell but you get 3 at once that spin around your kart and can be fired individually. If an opponent barges into you while you have 3 shells they will spin out and slow down.</p><h3>Banana Skin</h3><p style=\"\">The Banana skin is dropped behind the player and lays on the track. If it is run over by another player it causes them to spin out and slow down. Can also be fired out in front of you by pressing up on the d-pad while firing.</p><h3>Banana Skin x3</h3><p style=\"\">Like the Banana skin but you get 3 at once that spin around your kart and can be dropped or fired individually.</p><h3>Mushroom</h3><p style=\"\">Gives a temporary burst of speed.</p><h3>Mushroom x3</h3><p style=\"\">Like the Mushroom but you get 3 at once that can be used individually.</p><h3>Bob-omb</h3><p style=\"\">A bomb that can be fired out in front of you and will explode on impact causing everyone in the impact zone to spin out. Can also be dropped behind you.</p><h3>Blue Shell</h3><p style=\"\">Will seek out and destroy the person in first place. It will explode in a similar fashion to a bob-omb and cause the driver to spin out.</p><h3>Fake item block</h3><p style=\"\">This item looks like an item block and anyone who drives into it will spin out and slow down.</p><h3>Golden Mushroom</h3><p style=\"\">This will give the player unlimited speed boosts within a short period of time. The player can keep boosting until the time runs out.</p><h3>Bullet Bill</h3><p style=\"\">Turns the player into a large bullet for a small amount of time and will also put you into autopilot. If you hit anyone when you are a bullet you will cause them to spin out and slow down.</p><h3>Blooper</h3><p style=\"\">This will cover your opponents screen with a blotch of ink, making driving very difficult.</p><h3>Lightning</h3><p style=\"\">This causes cars that are ahead of you to shrink and reduce their speed. Small karts can be made to spin out by barging into them.</p><h3>Star</h3><p style=\"\">This makes the player invincible for a small amount of time. The players speed will increase and barging into other players will cause them to spin out and slow down.</p><h3>Boo</h3><p style=\"\">Will cause the character to go invisible. This means that the player can drive through things on the road such as bananas and fake blocks. The ghost character ‘<a data-ref-id=\"3015-3682\" href=\"/boo/3015-3682/\" slug=\"boo\">Boo</a>’ will also steal items from other characters and give them to you.</p><h2>Characters</h2><figure

Charged pits classic Nintendo characters such as Mario, Princess Peach, and Diddy Kong against each other in exaggerated, fast-paced soccer matches.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62615/1182375-mario_strikers_charged_logo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1182375\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62615/1182375-mario_strikers_charged_logo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1182375\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62615/1182375-mario_strikers_charged_logo.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The logo for the game</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Generally, two teams each of five characters fight for control of a soccer ball, which can be passed between characters freely as they progress down the field toward the goal. As the ball is passed around the field or when special dribble moves are performed, the ball increases in temperature and glows brighter. The hotter it is, the greater the chance the player has of scoring when shooting.</p><p style=\"\">Occasionally, when specific conditions are met (e.g. when a character takes a powerful shot at the net), that player's team is awarded an item. These have a variety of different effects, such as granting temporary speed boosts, disabling the other team's characters, and so on. All characters in the game can perform special shots, the power of which is determined by the character's status on the team. Captains shoot Mega Strikes, which are very powerful super moves, difficult to defend against, and very fast. Sidekicks perform Skillshots, which have the ability to disable or bypass the goalie.</p><h2>Game modes</h2><ul><li><b>Road to the Striker Cup</b> - Main single / co-op player mode consisting of three different cups</li><li><b>Strikers 101 (ABC)</b> - Ten step tutorial for mastering the controls</li><li><b>Domination Mode</b> - Basically exhibition mode</li><li><b>Striker Challenges</b> - Challenge mode</li></ul><h3>Road to the Striker Cup</h3><p style=\"\">The main game consists of three cups.</p><ul><li><b>Fire Cup</b> - Beat three other teams to reach Bowser Jr.</li><li><b>Crystal Cup</b> - Beat five other teams to reach Diddy Kong</li><li><b>Striker Cup</b> - Beat nine other teams to reach Petey Piranha</li></ul><h2>Characters</h2><p style=\"\">Characters are split into two categories, Captains and Sidekicks.

At the time that Super Mario RPG was developed, Square and Nintendo had an excellent relationship, with Square making several great games on the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-2795\" href=\"/snes/3055-2795/\" slug=\"snes\">Super Nintendo</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3045-21\" href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" slug=\"nes\">NES</a>. Super Mario RPG was a more story-centered version of the Mario titles on the NES and Super Nintendo that came beforehand.</p><p style=\"\">Super Mario RPG was added to Nintendo's digital download service on the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-36\" href=\"/wii/3045-36/\" slug=\"wii\">Wii</a>, the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2925\" href=\"/virtual-console/3015-2925/\" slug=\"virtual-console\">Virtual Console</a>, on Labor Day, September 1, 2008, in the United States. It was added to the Virtual Console in Europe on August 22, 2008, making Super Mario RPG available for the first time overseas. This happened during the Hanabi week, a release week Nintendo dedicates to games previously unreleased in Europe. The original Super Nintendo cartridge wouldn't work with import adapters available back then, so the game couldn't be played without an American Super Nintendo. Super Mario RPG costs the standard Super Nintendo price of 800 Nintendo Points to purchase the game (900 Nintendo Points in Europe). The game takes up 59 blocks of Wii Memory in the United States and 64 blocks of memory in Europe. The game is compatible with the Wii <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2522\" href=\"/classic-controller-support/3015-2522/\" slug=\"classic-controller-support\">Classic Controller</a> and the Nintendo GameCube controller.</p><p style=\"\">The changes made to the Wii version of the game from it's original Super NES release are few and fairly insignificant, but here is a short list of some of the changes or differences:</p><ul><li>There is more slowdown in the game, which is pretty significant in some portions, such as the boss fight with JJJ.</li><li>There are a few spots where one will see weird visual glitches, such as in battles where it will cover the main characters for a bit.</li><li>The Fire Wall attack from enemies has changed color. Instead of being red/orange and white it is now red and black/translucent.</li><li>The Mokuka enemy in Land's End can appear as a blue cloud instead of just white.</li><li>Timed Hits can be made harder to perform when playing with a Classic Controller due to the face buttons on the controller being raised higher. Thus it takes a longer amount of time for one to press the button down all the way. This can make timing harder to do if one is playing with the Classic Controller or Nintendo GameCube Controller.</li></ul><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">Super Mario RPG is one of the most unique RPGs for its time, and is still unconventional today. This is due to the fact that Super Mario RPG incorporates <a data-ref-id=\"3015-379\" href=\"/jump/3015-379/\" slug=\"jump\">jumping elements</a> into all aspects of its gameplay; from traversing the overworld, to fighting battles, the developers worked hard to make the game feel like a Mario game, and that meant a significant portion of the game needed to utilize the typical Mario gameplay of jumping. The gameplay is similar to that of later game Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga on the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-4\" href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4/\" slug=\"game-boy-advance\">Game Boy Advance</a>.</p><p style=\"\">The game is seen from an <a data-ref-id=\"3015-246\" href=\"/isometric-viewpoint/3015-246/\" slug=\"isometric-viewpoint\">isometric perspective</a> and the game gives the player the freedom to jump on objects. Not only does this allow one to reach places which can only be hit by jumping, but the game also has many hidden treasure chests strewn throughout the game. These chests can only be found by jumping into them from below, at which point they will appear and reward players with their contents.This is very typical of previous Mario titles, as invisible blocks would give the players rewards like stars.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8757/229940-super_mario_rpg_battle_screenshot.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-229940\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8757/229940-super_mario_rpg_battle_screenshot.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-229940\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8757/229940-super_mario_rpg_battle_screenshot.png\"></a><figcaption>A traditional battle. This particular battle is against the boss Belome.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Unlike most RPGs of it's time, Super Mario RPG does not contain random battles. Instead, one can see enemies walking around on the overworld. If one touches them, a battle will take place on a separate battle screen. Naturally, this means one can avoid fighting. Battles are menu based, which makes the game feel like a typical RPG, but setting it apart are what the game dubs \" Timed Hits\". Timed Hits come into play when both attacking and defending in battle. When one attacks, whether it's with a normal attack or a \"Special Attack\", one can do more damage if one presses a button at just the right time. This also goes for defending against attacks from an enemy. This requires one to press the \"A button\" at the right time to reduce the effect of damage, or even take no damage at all.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8757/229946-1024215527_00.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-229946\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8757/229946-1024215527_00.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-229946\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8757/229946-1024215527_00.jpg\"></a><figcaption>While walking around the overworld, enemies are visible.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Outside of those aspects, Super Mario RPG is a very conventional role-playing game (RPG). One traverses the world, both towns and \" <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1131\" href=\"/dungeon/3035-1131/\" slug=\"dungeon\">dungeons</a>\", chatting with <a data-ref-id=\"3015-967\" href=\"/non-player-character/3015-967/\" slug=\"non-player-character\">townsfolk</a>, taking part in a very large number of mini-games, fighting enemies and bosses to level up, purchase or find items and equipment to increase stats or help in a battle and keying story sequences to move the game's plot forward (although there are no \"cut-scenes\", most of the dialogue and story takes place within the game's text windows as various characters speak). It's also significant to note that Mario is mute in this game, although he will \"act out\" what he wants to say at certain points, often to hilarious effect; he will even morph into other characters, an unexplained phenomenon that is seen with indifference by in-game characters.</p><h3>Mini-Games</h3><p style=\"\">Mini-games of all kinds can be found throughout Mario's adventure for the Seven Stars. Some of the mini-games are part of the story and one will experience them in one form or another before one can play them at a time of his choosing, while other mini-games are completely optional. In addition to the many mini-games, there are numerous side-quests that will reward one with items and equipment that can significantly help in Mario's adventure.</p><p style=\"\"><b>Melody Bay</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/688560-super_mario_rpg___legend_of_the_seven_stars.061.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-688560\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/688560-super_mario_rpg___legend_of_the_seven_stars.061.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-688560\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/688560-super_mario_rpg___legend_of_the_seven_stars.061.png\"></a><figcaption>Playing the Melody Bay minigame</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Price: Free</li><li>Prizes: Alto Card, Tenor Card and Soprano Card</li></ul><p style=\"\">Melody Bay can be found at Tadpole Pond and allows the player to compose \"songs\" by jumping on tadpoles that represent different notes (stand on the rock in front of the music lines to summon them) and each make a different sound (Mi, Do, So, Do, Re, La, Ti, Do). There are three songs one will be able to compose in order to win an item from Toadofsky (a composer with composer's block). They are relatively easy to find except for the last one.

The Goombas pop out of four pipes. Mario stands in the middle with a green pipe in each corner, and one is tasked with jumping onto the pipe to smash a Goomba when they pop out. A small handful of Spineys will also pop out of the pipes. If one smashes a Goomba, a point if given. If one smashes a Spiney, three points shall be taken.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/687882-super_mario_rpg___legend_of_the_seven_stars.026.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-687882\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/687882-super_mario_rpg___legend_of_the_seven_stars.026.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-687882\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/687882-super_mario_rpg___legend_of_the_seven_stars.026.png\"></a><figcaption>Mushroom Derby Racing</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><b>Mushroom Derby Racing</b></p><ul><li>Price: 3 Cookies</li><li>Prizes: 3 Yoshi Cookie Items, the ability to race other Yoshis.</li></ul><p style=\"\">One will find the Mushroom Derby in Yo'ster Isle.

A timer in the upper right keeps track of how long it takes one to reach the end of the track. The track has a general path although one will encounter side rides one can enter by holding right or left when one passes by them as well as turns in which one will need to break to avoid going off the track. If one goes off the track it takes a bit for Mario to return to the track, thus cutting down finish time. Twice one will enter a side-scrolling section which plays much differently than the 3D parts as there are platforming elements. As one goes through the track one can collect coins as well as Mushrooms, which one uses to boost. Initially one will play this mini-game as part of the story, and whatever time is gotten is the time one will need to beat in order to earn more coins when the mini-game is opened later on as a game the player can play anytime at a cost of 10 Coins. Beat the previous time to earn coins. If the player wagers 30 coins and beats the old time, the player earns 50 coins.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/817430-beetlemaina.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-817430\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/817430-beetlemaina.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-817430\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/817430-beetlemaina.gif\"></a><figcaption>Beetle Mania</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><b>Beetle Mania (Listed as \"Game\" on the Menu when it is obtained)</b></p><ul><li>Cost: 500 Coins to purchase the Game Boy, free to play afterward</li><li>Prizes: Coins for Male and Female Beetles, a Frog Coin per Golden Beetle</li></ul><p style=\"\">Beetle Mania is a shooter in which the player controls a Beetle who can move left and right along the bottom of a static screen as Koopa Shells fall in from all angles from above. The player can shoot Stars out of the Beetle as fast as the buttons are pressed in order to break the Koopa shells. Doing so will cause them to shatter and release stars, which will break any shells they hit. But be careful! If the stars from a shattered shell hit the player, then they will die as well. To revive, the player must rapidly press the buttons, using either A or B to fire. As stars from shattered shells hit other shells they will cause them to explode. If a large enough combo is obtained, hearts will start falling from the sky. Collecting them increases the score.

Princess Toadstool has been kidnapped by Bowser and Mario must fight his way through his castle to bring her back. During this highly familiar sequence, Mario fights and defeats Bowser. Right as Mario is about to claim victory and return home with the princess, a huge magical sword named Exor crashes through the castle, sending all parties flying off into the horizon. The crash flings Mario into the Warp Pipe on the roof of his house. Toad, distraught that Mario did not return with the Princess, urges Mario to return to Bowser's Keep. When he returns, he finds Exor has claimed the castle as Smithy Gang headquarters and their plan is take over the world. Smashing the bridge to Bowser's castle, Mario has to find another way around.</p><p style=\"\">Mario returns home and he and Toad go to inform the Chancellor of what has happened. After talking to him, Mario runs into Mallow, who introduces himself as a frog from Tadpole Pond. He asks for Mario's help in getting his Frog Coin back from a thief called Croco. The two defeat him and return to the Mushroom Kingdom, where they find the Mushroom Kingdom taken over by Smithy's Gang. They save the townspeople and enter the castle, running into Mack, one of Smithy's lackeys, in the throne room. Defeating him, Mario receives a Star Piece, not sure what it is. With his resolve to save Princess Toadstool restored, Mario sets off with Mallow to uncover what the Star Piece means by talking to Mallow's Grandfather, Frogfucious.</p><p style=\"\">The duo travels through the Kero Sewers, defeating Belome, and barrels down the Midas River. When Mario and Mallow reach Frogfucious at Tadpole Pond, he reveals that he is not really Mallow's grandfather and his real parents are out there somewhere. With another new mission, the two set off to Rose Town. Meanwhile, Bowser and what remains of his minions meet up and proclaim they will take back Bowser's Castle.</p><p style=\"\">When Mario gets to Rose Town, they find the town under attack by paralyzing arrows. Looking for clues to what's happening, the party finds shelter in an inn and run into a little boy who plays with dolls. During playtime, one of the dolls, Geno, knocks out Mario and the party has to stay the night. In the middle of the night, a star gives Geno life and he walks into the Forest Maze to find and stop the source of the arrows.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h3>Super Mario</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/687936-super_mario_rpg___legend_of_the_seven_stars.008.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-687936\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/687936-super_mario_rpg___legend_of_the_seven_stars.008.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-687936\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/687936-super_mario_rpg___legend_of_the_seven_stars.008.png\"></a><figcaption>Super Mario</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">After being flung from <a data-ref-id=\"3035-685\" href=\"/bowsers-castle/3035-685/\" slug=\"bowsers-castle\">Bowser's keep</a>, Mario tries to return, only to find that a <a data-ref-id=\"3005-7302\" href=\"/exor/3005-7302/\" slug=\"exor\">large sword</a> now sticking out of the keep will have none of it.

Once they arrive and meet Frogfucius he tells Mallow that he is not a tadpole (he resembles a cloud wearing pants).

It is during this time that the otherworldly traveler decides to utilize the body of the doll to quest against Smithy. He/She/It then runs off into the Forest Maze while everyone is asleep. Mario eventually finds Geno in the Forest Maze, where they team up to defeat <a data-ref-id=\"3005-8384\" href=\"/bowyer/3005-8384/\" slug=\"bowyer\">Bowyer</a>, a lunatic bow-like creature that is raining hell upon Rosetown by firing arrows that freeze people in place.</p><p style=\"\">Note: Geno is merely a name of convenience, the actual name of this character is ♥♪!?; it's much easier to say Geno in conversation.</p><h3>Princess Toadstool</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/687900-super_mario_rpg___legend_of_the_seven_stars.044.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-687900\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/687900-super_mario_rpg___legend_of_the_seven_stars.044.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-687900\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/687900-super_mario_rpg___legend_of_the_seven_stars.044.png\"></a><figcaption>Princess Toadstool</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">After the incident at Bowser's Castle, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-709\" href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709/\" slug=\"princess-peach\">Princess Toadstool</a> lands on the lap (literally) of the man-child <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3729\" href=\"/booster/3005-3729/\" slug=\"booster\">Booster</a> in Booster's Tower.

He shows up a few times in passing while Mario is questing in Moleville, but they don't make contact until the arrival at Booster Tower. Bowser consistently fails at getting inside of the Tower and ultimately decides to <a data-ref-id=\"3015-813\" href=\"/villain-turned-good/3015-813/\" slug=\"villain-turned-good\">team up with Mario</a>.</p><h2>Humor</h2><p style=\"\">Super Mario RPG is well-known for its laugh-out-loud hilarity. The game's <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2257\" href=\"/humor/3015-2257/\" slug=\"humor\">humor</a> and style are all its own, and will likely continue to be funny in future generations of gaming. Much of the game's charm and comedy come from Mario himself, whom despite his silence, has a wide range of funny and expressive animations. Much of the humor works in a very slapstick manner, such as Mario's often violent expressions, characters' prat-falls when an obvious point is made, and the constant bumbling actions by the game's many npcs.</p><p style=\"\">The game also pokes fun at its protagonist and video game semblances to humorous effect.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1023772-callmegeno.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1023772\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1023772-callmegeno.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1023772\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1023772-callmegeno.gif\"></a><figcaption>Geno is actually a doll.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">One example of this is when Geno is first encountered; he is just one \"action figure\" in a line-up of action figures that includes Mario, Bowser and Princess Peach. A young child, Gaz, is playing with them in the Rosetown Inn and when he discovers that Mario is \"THE MARIO\" (which is proved by an elaborate jump, something that happens throughout the game in order for Mario to \"prove\" who he really is), he asks that Mario join him. What proceeds is Gaz playing with Mario as Gaz and Mario exchange \"blows.\" In the end, Mario gets \"knocked out\" from a super attack that Gaz unleashed on him with his \"secret weapon\", the Geno doll.</p><h2>Special Items</h2><p style=\"\">There are a number of secret challenges in the game, and once you complete them you will get special Items.</p><h3>Attack Scarf</h3><p style=\"\">In Monstro town an NPC will challenge you to complete over 30 jumps. This is a reference to Mario's special 'Super Jump' and 'Ultra Jump' abilities. Once 30 jumps is completed return to the NPC and he/she will reward you with the Attack Scarf accessory.</p><h3>Super Suit</h3><p style=\"\">Perhaps the most difficult item in the game to obtain. Similar to the Attack Scarf, the Super Suit can be obtained if you complete 100 successful jumps with the 'Super Jump' or 'Ultra Jump' ability. When you have completed this taks return to the NPC in Monstro town, and claim your prize. This item vastly increases your attack level, and defence level.</p><h2>Cameos</h2><p style=\"\">During the course of the game, many <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2\" href=\"/easter-egg/3015-2/\" slug=\"easter-egg\">Easter eggs</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1014\" href=\"/cameo-appearance/3015-1014/\" slug=\"cameo-appearance\">hidden characters</a> are available to encounter.</p><h3>Samus Aran Cameo</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/208706-ss_smrpg_samus2.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-208706\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/208706-ss_smrpg_samus2.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-208706\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/208706-ss_smrpg_samus2.gif\"></a><figcaption>Samus Aran in the Mushroom Kingdom</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3005-99\" href=\"/samus-aran/3005-99/\" slug=\"samus-aran\">Samus Aran</a> is located in two places in Super Mario RPG.

There is a sealed door there that can be opened with the Shiny Stone. In Moleville, there is a person who will sell the party fireworks. After purchasing some, the party must go outside to where there are five crates and a little girl mole sitting down. She is willing to trade her Shiny Stone for the party's fireworks.</p><p style=\"\">Culex is a throw-back to <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2231\" href=\"/angelic-bosses/3015-2231/\" slug=\"angelic-bosses\">classic Final Fantasy bosses</a>, and is the hardest boss in the game, even more so then the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1537\" href=\"/final-boss/3015-1537/\" slug=\"final-boss\">final boss</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1730\" href=\"/smithy/3005-1730/\" slug=\"smithy\">Smithy</a>. Culex is described as a Dark Knight from Vanda, and he has crossed over to Mario's realm in order to defeat the Dark Mage. Culex is not able to stay in Mario's world for long, for if he does it will lead to his destruction. Before Culex departs, he wishes to battle the strongest knight of the world.</p><p style=\"\">While fighting Culex, the boss battle theme from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20829\" href=\"/final-fantasy-iv/3030-20829/\" slug=\"final-fantasy-iv\">Final Fantasy IV</a> plays, and upon defeating Culex the pre- <a data-ref-id=\"3030-13053\" href=\"/final-fantasy-vii/3030-13053/\" slug=\"final-fantasy-vii\">Final Fantasy VII</a> victory theme plays. There are also other references to Final Fantasy in the game, but Culex is the most prominent. Upon defeat, Culex rewards the player with the Quartz Charm and departs.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p style=\"\">The soundtrack to Super Mario RPG was a collaboration between <a data-ref-id=\"3040-54084\" href=\"/yoko-shimomura/3040-54084/\" slug=\"yoko-shimomura\">Yoko Shimomura</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-606\" href=\"/koji-kondo/3040-606/\" slug=\"koji-kondo\">Koji Kondo</a>. <a data-ref-id=\"3040-635\" href=\"/nobuo-uematsu/3040-635/\" slug=\"nobuo-uematsu\">Nobuo Uematsu</a> also appears on the soundtrack, composing the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-13871\" href=\"/culex/3005-13871/\" slug=\"culex\">Culex</a> songs.

While exploring the town further however, she gets approached by a mysterious cloaked figure who surreptitiously hands Peach a treasure chest. She then goes on to state that the treasure chest can only be opened by \"one with a pure heart\". Unable to keep her curiosity in order, the princess impatiently opens the chest to discover a worn down old treasure map. Apparently incapable to search for the treasure herself, she sends it to <a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Mario</a> in hopes of receiving his help once again.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/361186-house.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-361186\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/361186-house.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-361186\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2714/361186-house.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The Mario Bros. residence with Parakarry.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">One bright and sunny day Mario and <a href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\">Luigi</a>, while lounging in their private accommodation, receive a letter (brought by a familiar face from the previous title.) from Princess Peach.

However, Mario, unshaken in his resolve, assures the captain everything is fine and dandy, and thus powerless to stop the poor man, the gentleman sails away, leaving Mario behind on the docks of this murky port town.</p><p style=\"\">Quickly accustomed to his surroundings, Mario hastily makes his way down the docks to unite with Princess Peach, only to come upon a scene the likes only seen in fairy tales.

Being the true nobleman he is known for, Mario steps in for the lesser party and thus gets acquainted with a <a href=\"/goomba/3015-2891/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2891\">Goomba</a> called <a href=\"/goombella/3005-2544/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2544\">Goombella</a>. She immediately grabs this chance to use Mario as her escort and somewhat turn the tides on the opposing force.

Unhinged by this, Mario quickly stumbles upon Toadsworth, who is quick to inform the fact that Peach has gone missing.

Having met Goombella before, Frankly mistakenly recalls her for somebody else, only to be somewhat scolded. Handing out the map, Frankly let's out an unmistakable \"<b>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEH?!</b>\" before informing Mario that he has recovered a great archaeological treasure. The map is tied to a great one thousand year old legend that a great treasure sleeps within the vicinity of the sewers of the city. This treasure is hidden within the very depths of the city's foundation behind a great passageway only known as \"The Thousand Year Door\".</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27545/1060996-glitz_pit.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1060996\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27545/1060996-glitz_pit.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1060996\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27545/1060996-glitz_pit.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The Glitz Pit in Glitzville.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Having traveled down innumerable warp pipes, passageways, and sewer sections, Mario finally confronts the massive monstrosity of masonry known as \"The Thousand Year Door\".

Unlike most turn-based RPGs, you cannot merely pick a move and watch a cinematic. Instead, you are prompted to do button commands while pulling off the move. Performing the action commands correctly will yield higher damage. For example, if you were to jump on a Goomba, you could push A right when you land on the Goomba and Mario will do a double-jump attack. You can also push A or B while being attacked to lower the amount of damage received or do a counter-attack and damage the enemy a small amount. In addition, Mario can jump on top of the enemy or hit them with his hammer outside in the overworld to damage enemies before the battle even begins.

These moves involve causing massive damage, healing Mario and his partner, and boosting Mario’s attack and defense stats. These mini-games include a variety of things. One of them makes you try to draw a circle around the enemy as many times as possible to cause damage, while others make you time button-pushing in order to damage the enemy. The more Crystal Stars Mario gets, the bigger his star meter gets, which lets him pull off bigger special moves and lets him use the smaller ones more often. One of The Thousand-Year Door’s more unique battle features is how the game takes place on a stage. As the battle starts to get more chaotic, props will fall down on the combatants, stage crew will accidentally drop lights, and there is even crowd that will get involved with the battle. If Mario and his partners pull of the action commands correctly, more spectators will join the crowd. The reverse also holds true; if Mario and his partners fail to perform moves correctly, crowd members will start leaving. Mario can also get style points by pushing certain buttons (The game doesn’t tell you; you have to find out about style moves by experimenting) after performing the action command. Getting the crowd really excited will help refill your star meter so Mario can perform more special moves. Crowd members will also throw items at Mario; it could either be an item to regain health, or a hammer to cause harm. Mario or one of his other party members can quickly jump on top of the crowd members to stop the item from being thrown and effectively scare that spectator away.</p><h3>Special Moves</h3><table><tbody><tr><th>Crystal Star Required</th><th>Power</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>Map</td><td>Sweet-Treat</td><td>Can replenish up to 7HP and 8FP for both party members and cure status aliments.</td></tr><tr><td>Diamond Star</td><td>Earth Tremor</td><td>Causes an earthquake which can do up to 6 damage to all ground based enemies.</td></tr><tr><td>Emerald Star</td><td>Clock Out</td><td>Immobilizes all enemies temporarily.</td></tr><tr><td>Gold Star</td><td>Power Lift</td><td>Boost attack and defense power for both party members temporarily.</td></tr><tr><td>Ruby Star</td><td>Art Attack</td><td>Circles the enemies as many times as possible to cause damage to them all.</td></tr><tr><td>Sapphire Star</td><td>Sweet Feast</td><td>Similar to Sweet-Treat, but Mario and his partner can replenish up to 24HP and 24FP.</td></tr><tr><td>Garnet Star</td><td>Showstopper</td><td>If done successfully, will KO all enemies unless they have more than 12HP or are classed as a 'boss'.</td></tr><tr><td>Crystal Star</td><td>Super Nova</td><td>Can causes a total of 15 damage too all enemies.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Levels</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70944/1233658-glitz_pit.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1233658\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70944/1233658-glitz_pit.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1233658\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/70944/1233658-glitz_pit.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The Glitz Pit, a battle arena located in Glitzville.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Outside of battle there are some fairly simple puzzles that must be solved. These usually involve using the partners’ special abilities. There are also many paper forms that Mario can turn into. These involve turning into a paper airplane, a paper roll up, a paper boat, and more. These forms all help move about levels in ways that couldn’t be accessed by foot. There also parts of the game where you can play as Peach and Bowser. In the parts where you play as Peach, you move around in the base that she is captured in to collect more information about the enemy. She then uses the computer, TEC, to send emails to Mario about this information.</p><h2>Bonus Missions</h2><p style=\"\">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door contains plenty of bonus missions outside of the main quest line. including side-quests, collectibles and challenges.</p><h3>Trouble Center Side Quests</h3><p style=\"\">The Trouble Center is where Mario goes to collect side quests, these quests can range from finding a lost key in Rougeport or finding the prices of items in a shop to more harder quests such as finding legendary cook books to finding hidden badges that certain a thief wants.</p><h3>The Pit of 100-Trials</h3><p style=\"\">The Pit of 100-Trials is located underneath Rougeport, it consists of 100 floors going down, each floor contains an enemy, each floor get gradually harder until you get to the 100th floor where you face Bonetail, Hooktail's and Gloomtail's long lost relative. Every 10th floor of the pit is a safe floor where you can rest, save the game, buy items or badges or leave the pit.</p><h3>Badges</h3><p style=\"\">Badges can be equipped onto Mario giving him extra abilities, these badges can be obtained by finding them in the environment, buying them from shops, trading star pieces for them or being gifted them by characters from the game. Each badge has certain badge points which Mario only has a certain amount he can equip, he can get more BP by leveling up. The most rarest badges in the game can change Mario's attire, the W emblem changes his attire to Wario, the L emblem changes his attire to Luigi, and if they're both equipped Mario will wear Waluigi's attire.</p><h3>Zess T.'s Food</h3><p style=\"\">Once you buy a replacement contact lens for Zess T. she will let you into the West side of Rougeport, but she also cooks items for you, you can turn items into more useful food items. If you give Zess T. the legendary cookbook from Creepy Steeple she will be able to cook two ingredients at the same time for you.</p><h3>Tattle Log</h3><p style=\"\">One of Goombella's abilities is Tattle which allows her to show you the enemies HP, defense and attack power. Once she tattles an enemy it goes into her tattle log. There are 124 separate enemies in the game which have to be tattled to fill up the Tattle Log.</p><h2>Other Info</h2><p style=\"\">1 player</p><p style=\"\">Memory blocks needed: <b>17</b></p><p style=\"\">Progressive Scan compatible (480p)</p><p style=\"\">Dolby Pro Logic II</p>",

The game retains all of the traditional gameplay of the original, all whilst adding new features, power-ups, and a large graphic facelift. New Super Mario Bros. also added two-player wireless multiplayer for battles, and up to four-player wireless for minigames (similar to those found in <a href=\"/super-mario-64-ds/3030-8942/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8942\">Super Mario 64 DS</a>). New Super Mario Bros. was very well received, with critics praising the updates in the game. New Super Mario Bros. currently has an 89.42% average on Game Rankings, and an 89% average on Metacritic. New Super Mario Bros. has sold 29.09 million units worldwide as of April 2012.</p><p style=\"\">The story of New Super Mario Bros. is essentially one and the same as the NES game's plot. The game follows <a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Mario</a>, on a quest to rescue <a href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-709\">Princess Peach</a> (after she is kidnapped by the evil <a href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-337\">Bowser</a>). Mario fights many of Bowser's peons, from <a href=\"/goomba/3015-2891/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2891\">Goombas</a> to <a href=\"/koopa-troopa/3015-2557/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2557\">Koopas</a>. <a href=\"/bowser-jr/3005-825/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-825\">Bowser Jr.</a> also is a prominent enemy in New Super Mario Bros., and Mario fights him several times.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/240383-920787_20060509_screen005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-240383\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/240383-920787_20060509_screen005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-240383\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/56/240383-920787_20060509_screen005.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The game is in 2.5D; a 3D game played on a 2D plane</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">New Super Mario Bros. retains much of the gameplay aspects that the original Super Mario Bros. contained, all while \"modernizing\" the ideas presented. One such way the game does this is by having the entire game in 3D one a 2D side-scrolling plane (known as 2.5D). Playing as either Mario or <a href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\">Luigi</a>, the player traverses one of several levels, with the goal to reach the flag at the end of the level. Along the way, there are enemies and obstacles to contend with (with varying environments, from the well-known World 1-1, to later levels containing lava). Bowser's henchmen are also there, ranging from the cannon fodder Goombas, to nigh-invincible <a href=\"/piranha-plant/3015-794/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-794\">Piranha Plants</a>. There are other ways to die other than landing in lava or getting hit by an enemy. Falling into a pit or getting crushed by collapsing ceilings or spikes, for example.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1851/448016-600px_mkwii_megamushroom.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-448016\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1851/448016-600px_mkwii_megamushroom.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-448016\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1851/448016-600px_mkwii_megamushroom.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The new Mega Mushroom</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Naturally, there are power-ups and moves to assist Mario on his quest. One addition includes the <a href=\"/wall-jump/3015-5/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5\">wall jump</a> making its first appearance in a 2D Mario game (since its introduction in <a href=\"/super-mario-64/3030-2931/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2931\">Super Mario 64</a>). Another technique that has been added is the <a href=\"/ground-pound/3015-1532/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1532\">ground pound</a> (which was first seen in <a href=\"/super-mario-world-2-yoshis-island/3030-2866/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2866\">Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island</a>, and first used by Mario in <a href=\"/super-mario-64/3030-2931/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2931\">Super Mario 64</a> ). Power-ups for Mario include the original power-ups: <a href=\"/super-mushroom/3055-49/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-49\">Super Mushroom</a> (grows Mario in size), <a href=\"/fire-flower/3055-10/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-10\">Fire Flower</a> (gives Mario the ability to throw fireballs), and <a href=\"/starman/3055-23/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-23\">Starman</a> (makes Mario temporarily invincible). Other power-ups have been added: Blue Koopa Shell (allows Mario to travel inside a shell, invincible against almost anything), <a href=\"/mega-mushroom/3055-999/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-999\">Mega Mushroom</a> (grows Mario into gargantuan proportions so that he can crush anything in the stage), and <a href=\"/mini-mushroom/3055-994/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-994\">Mini Mushroom</a> (shrinks Mario down into minuscule size, so he can fit in smaller holes).</p><p style=\"\">In New Super Mario Bros. there are eight worlds, each consisting of ten levels. Each level contains a flag (the goal), and at the end of each world is a boss. Every world ranges in design, usually presenting a new idea or obstacle that must be surpassed. The worlds include a typical valley (World 1), a desert (World 2), a tropical area (World 3), a rain forest that contains poisonous water (World 4), an ice world (World 5), a mountainous region (World 6), a cloudy world (World 7), and a lava-filled area that is Bowser's home (World 8). Worlds 4 and 7 are only available to a player after beating the previous world's castle (Worlds 3 and 6, respectively) while under the effects of a Mini Mushroom.</p><p style=\"\">The multiplayer mode in New Super Mario Bros. places two players in an area based off of one of the worlds in New Super Mario Bros. There are five places to go to: Grass Stage (World 1-1), Underground Stage (World 1-2), Ice Stage (World 5), Pipe Stage (World 7), and Castle Stage (World 8). The multiplayer mode is simple; the player to collect the most stars wins. Players can set the amount of stars to race to before the game begins. When it does begin, the two players can gather power-ups, stars, and coins in a race to obtain the preset amount. By attacking one another (by jumping on each other or through a power-up), players can steal each other's stars. The multiplayer mode is only wireless multiplayer with two DS cartridges, it does not support DS Download Play or Nintendo Wi-Fi. Much like Super Mario 64 DS, New Super Mario Bros. contains a variety of minigames (eighteen for a single player and ten for multiple players). There are several minigames: Action, Puzzle, Table, and Variety are the categories.</p><p style=\"\">Level wise, if a player knows all of the secret exits in the game and can get the proper suit before each one, it is possible to do a playthrough of the game where you only play levels from worlds 1,5 and 8. You find the canon in world 1 after the 2nd level. That canon leads to the fifth world, and you can skip ahead in world 5 to the ghost house where the exit to the canon is which leads to world 8. So in a good playthrough the player only needs to play through one world in its entirety (world 8 due to the fact that it is not a branching path).</p><h3>Minigames</h3><p style=\"\">In addition to the main game, the game also includes several minigames.

The game was the first Nintendo GameCube game to be packaged with (and make use of) the GameCube microphone. Mario Party 6 was generally well-received, with a 73% rating on Game Rankings and a 71% rating on Metacritic.</p><p style=\"\">The plot of the game involves <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10378\" href=\"/brighton/3005-10378/\" slug=\"brighton\">Brighton</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10379\" href=\"/twila/3005-10379/\" slug=\"twila\">Twila</a>, two characters introduced in the game, arguing over who is the more popular of the two. To decide who is the most popular, a contest is started to see who can gather the most stars.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6393/410419-mario_party_6_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-410419\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6393/410419-mario_party_6_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-410419\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6393/410419-mario_party_6_4.jpg\"></a><figcaption>One of the new Mic minigames.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Mario Party 6 has the traditional Mario Party gameplay. Players compete on a variety of game boards. The goal of the game is to collect the most stars (which are usually obtained by buying them at designated spaces). Coins can be collected by playing minigames. Some minigames differ in that they are being played for stars, rather than just coins.</p><p style=\"\">There are several different types of minigames available for play: four player minigames, two versus two, one versus three, battle, duel, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-299\" href=\"/donkey-kong/3005-299/\" slug=\"donkey-kong\">Donkey Kong</a> minigames, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-337\" href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\" slug=\"bowser\">Bowser</a> minigames, Rare minigames, and Mic minigames. Four player minigames pit all four players against each other, with a goal depending on what the minigame is. Two versus two is a team-based minigame, with two teams of two competing. A one versus three minigame has one player (typically with a large advantage) playing against the other three. Battle minigames are where each player must give coins that are then awarded to the first and second place players. Duel minigames are between two players, usually for an amount of coins or stars that each player has to contribute. Bowser minigames are almost exactly like one versus three minigames, except with Koopa Kids versus the rest of the players. Rare minigames are also one player minigames that the player can unlock (and are the goal in the single-player game). Mic minigames are multiplayer-only minigames that involve the use of the microphone (usually shouting commands for computer controlled opponents, or to alter the environment).</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/912437-mp6_toadette.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-912437\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/912437-mp6_toadette.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-912437\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/912437-mp6_toadette.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Toadette, the franchise's first secret character.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Orbs are the new feature that Mario Party 6 introduces.

Coins can also be found in Orbs, unlike the capsules. Orbs can also contain a variety of different other things, such as obstacles for other players, power-ups, or even a direct path to stars.</p><p style=\"\">Another feature that Mario Party 6 introduces is the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-92\" href=\"/daynight-cycle/3015-92/\" slug=\"daynight-cycle\">day and night cycle</a>.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2>  Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga was released in North America on November 17, 2003. It was developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-4049\" href=\"/alphadream-corporation-ltd/3010-4049/\">                              AlphaDream</a> and published by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\">                              Nintendo</a>. It marked the return of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-177\" href=\"/mario/3005-177/\">                              Mario</a> RPG’s to portable consoles.  Like many other Game Boy Advance Mario games at the time, Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga also has an option to play the original <a data-ref-id=\"3030-19726\" href=\"/mario-bros/3030-19726/\">                              Mario Bros.</a> (with updated graphics).  Gameplay is very similar to that of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-460\" href=\"/paper-mario/3025-460/\">                              Paper Mario</a> and Super Mario RPG, as well timed button presses allow the player to inflict more damage and reducing or countering enemy attacks. The game was granted a sequel, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-15439\" href=\"/mario-luigi-partners-in-time/3030-15439/\">                              Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time</a>, but it was criticized for not being as interesting or <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2257\" href=\"/humor/3015-2257/\">                              humorous</a> as its predecessor. <br /><br />In sprite-ripping communities, Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga is well-known for its colorful, cartoon style. The way the sprites are outlined (with small gray dots in certain locations) is also one of the style's key features.<br /><br />Unlike previous adventures, Superstar Saga takes place in the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1610\" href=\"/beanbean-kingdom/3035-1610/\">                              Beanbean Kingdom</a>. While certain parts of the game are located in the more familiar <a data-ref-id=\"3035-14\" href=\"/the-mushroom-kingdom/3035-14/\">                              Mushroom Kingdom</a>, the action and story all takes place in the Beanbean Kingdom. <br /><br /><h2>Gameplay</h2> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/231710-gfs_51962_2_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-231710\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/231710-gfs_51962_2_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-231710\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/56/231710-gfs_51962_2_2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>A battle early in the game</figcaption></figure>  The game introduced a new series of moves called <a data-ref-id=\"3015-327\" href=\"/special-attack/3015-327/\">                             Bros. Moves</a> in which Mario and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-370\" href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\">                              Luigi</a> attack as a team, when performing a Bros. Move players will relay on the amount of Bros Points (BP); the higher the BP the stronger the attack also the degree of difficulty of the move is determined by the amount of BP as a higher number required a more complex button combination. Mario and Luigi cooperation is also used outside of battles as the work together to solve different <a data-ref-id=\"3015-932\" href=\"/puzzles/3015-932/\">                         puzzles</a>.   As in any other role-playing game, in Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga players boost power by <a data-ref-id=\"3015-475\" href=\"/leveling-up/3015-475/\">                            leveling up</a>, in which several <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1681\" href=\"/attributes/3015-1681/\">                           stats</a> increase by each level gain, some of these stats include attack, speed and defense. Players can also improve their stats by collecting different items like clothing and badges.<br /><br />In the overworld, the game differs from a traditional RPG in many aspects. The ability to jump and solve  puzzles is one that is more commonly seen in action games, but (being the Mario brothers), these abilities are in place. The overworld gameplay is very similar to the SNES RPG <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7358\" href=\"/super-mario-rpg-legend-of-the-seven-stars/3030-7358/\">                              Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars</a>, a game from which Superstar Saga derives many of its gameplay aspects. Many of the puzzles in the overworld focus on the cooperation between the brothers; having the player take them on separate paths on several occasions. <br /> <br />Interestingly, Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga is one of the few Game Boy Advance games to use the rumble option when placed in the Game Boy Player on the Nintendo GameCube. <br /><br /><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/886232-1076206688_00.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-886232\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/886232-1076206688_00.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-886232\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/886232-1076206688_00.png\"></a><figcaption>The Goodwill Ambassador</figcaption></figure>The game begins with the Goodwill Ambassador from the Beanbean Kingdom (as well as his assistant) arriving the Mushroom Kingdom to present a gift for <a data-ref-id=\"3005-709\" href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709/\">                        Princess Peach</a> from the ruler of the Beanbean Kingdom, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9459\" href=\"/queen-bean/3005-9459/\">                       Queen Bean</a>. However, it turns up to be an attack by <a data-ref-id=\"3005-7182\" href=\"/cackletta/3005-7182/\">                      Cackletta</a>, an evil witch, and her quirky assistant <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2475\" href=\"/fawful/3005-2475/\">                     Fawful</a>. Fawful uses his headgear to steal Princess Peach's voice and replace it with a rather \"explosive\" (literally) vocabulary. Our heroes, Mario and Luigi, are at <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2375\" href=\"/marios-house/3035-2375/\">                   their house</a> when <a data-ref-id=\"3005-845\" href=\"/toad/3005-845/\">                  Toad</a> runs up screaming for help. Mario quickly gets ready to go to the castle, but doesn't realize he is dragging Luigi by the clothesline.<br /><br />When he reaches the castle, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-337\" href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\">                 Bowser</a> is there (who was attempting to kidnap Princess Peach, but couldn't because he was afraid she would blow up <a data-ref-id=\"3035-685\" href=\"/bowsers-castle/3035-685/\">                his castle</a> every time she spoke). Mario comes to a quick stop, and Luigi flies off the clothesline and hits Bowser. Bowser challenges Mario to the first \"<a data-ref-id=\"3015-50\" href=\"/boss-fight/3015-50/\">boss battle</a>\" of the game. After the battle, Bowser agrees to assist the brothers in getting back Princess Peach's voice.<br /><br />The first order of business is to go to the Beanbean Kingdom. Mario and Bowser are going to leave in the Koopa Cruiser, along with all of Bowser's <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1747\" href=\"/minions/3015-1747/\">              minions</a>. The Koopa Cruiser is about to fly off, when Luigi comes to say goodbye. Bowser thinks that Mario's brother is one of his minions, so he grabs him and puts him into the Koopa Cruiser. While the three are on the deck of the ship that night, they spot an unidentified object flying their way. It ends up to be Fawful and Cackletta, and Cackletta orders Fawful to stop them. Bowser gets taken out, but the brothers easily destroy Fawful's headgear, rendering him useless. Unfortunately, he still manages to destroy the Koopa Cruiser and it crashes on the Beanbean Borderlands.<br /><br />The brothers head into the building containing the Border Bros., who guard the border between the Mushroom and Beanbean Kingdoms. Mario and Luigi are given a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-660\" href=\"/map/3055-660/\">             map</a> of the Beanbean Kingdom, and are granted passage into the Stardust Fields. Eventually, they locate Bowser who is stuck in a cannon owned by Tolstar, the self-proclaimed king of Stardust Fields. He wants coins to free Bowser from the cannon. As the brothers are searching for coins, they encounter the Starshade Bros., who teach them Bros. Moves. When they give Tolstar the coins, however, he attacks. The brothers defeat him but due to a misconception, Bowser is fired out of the cannon.<br /><br /><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/886233-1076206737_00.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-886233\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/886233-1076206737_00.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-886233\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/886233-1076206737_00.png\"></a><figcaption>Hoohoo Village</figcaption></figure>As Mario and Luigi continue, they enter Hoohoo Village. Here, they find Fawful again, who blocks their path to the Beanbean Castle by placing a boulder in their path (that can only be destroyed with a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-308\" href=\"/hammer/3055-308/\">            hammer</a>). The Hammerhead Bros. live in Hoohoo Village, and they are willing to make hammers for the brothers if they can find a Hoohoo Stone on the top of Hoohoo <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2102\" href=\"/mountains/3035-2102/\">           Mountain</a>. They accidentally wake up Blablanadon in the process, however, who has been sitting on a large <a data-ref-id=\"3055-607\" href=\"/egg/3055-607/\">          egg</a> for some time (without knowledge of what the egg contains). When the egg hatches it has the Dragohoho in it.

Prince Peasley gifts the brothers with a special rose, which will allow them to enter the castle. The brothers go back down the mountain, gather their hammers, and continue on their quest to Beanbean Castle.<br /><br /><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/886242-mlss_beanstar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-886242\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/886242-mlss_beanstar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-886242\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/886242-mlss_beanstar.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Beanstar</figcaption></figure>When the duo make it to Beanbean Castle Town, it is evident that Cackletta has staged a recent attack. They hurry to the castle, where the rose grants them entrance, and meet with Queen Bean's head adviser, Lady Lima. She doesn't believe that the two are the famous Mario Bros., so she asks that they fix the castle's <a data-ref-id=\"3035-348\" href=\"/sewer/3035-348/\">       sewer</a>. While fixing the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-229\" href=\"/pipe/3055-229/\">      pipes</a>, Mario and Luigi discover the real Lady Lima, as well as some servants. They rush upstairs, where Cackletta had just succeeded in taking the Beanstar (a wish granting star), and sends Queen Bean to attack them. Having been transformed by eating a Belly Blech Worm, Mario and Luigi go to find the only known cure: Chuckola Cola.<br /><br />The Château de Chucklehuck is the only location in the Beanbean Kingdom where Chuckola Cola is brewed. There, the brothers encounter \"master thief\" <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9438\" href=\"/popple/3005-9438/\">     Popple</a>, and his sidekick <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1914\" href=\"/new-guy/3015-1914/\">    Rookie</a>. After easily disposing of them, the brothers find Cork and Cask, the owners of the château. After teaching the brothers new out-of-battle Bros. Moves, the duo uses these newfound moves to gather Chuckola Fruits to grant them access to the Mother Chuckola. The creator of Chuckola Cola, Bubbles, is in there, telling jokes to the soda, the rare Chuckola Reserve. He sends his creation to attack the brothers, now the Chuckolator. After defeating it, Mario and Luigi got it back safely to Queen Bean, where the antidote is applied. She instantly transforms to her normal self.<br /><br /><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/886254-woohoo_university.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-886254\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/886254-woohoo_university.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-886254\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/886254-woohoo_university.png\"></a><figcaption>Woohoo Hooniversity</figcaption></figure>Prince Peasley flies in to report that Cackletta has made a lair of some sorts in Woohoo Hoonivesrity, so naturally it is the brothers' job to investigate.

However, it causes the Beanstar to explode with anger, destroying the Peach Bots. Just then, Mario and Luigi jump in. They beat Cackletta to a pulp, which is when Fawful absorbs her spirit into his headgear. When he is about to fight the brothers himself, Prince Peasley sweeps in and knocks Fawful off into Stardust Fields.<br /><br /><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/886267-le_bleu.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-886267\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/886267-le_bleu.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-886267\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/886267-le_bleu.png\"></a><figcaption>Rookie</figcaption></figure>Meanwhile, the brothers find Popple and Rookie, who are trying to steal the Beanstar.  They are defeated by Mario and Luigi yet again, but after the battle a Peach Bot falls through the ceiling and irritates the Beanstar  again. It flies through the ceiling, with Mario, Luigi, Popple, and Rookie intact, launching them into four directions and breaking the Beanstar into four pieces. Mario and Luigi land on an island in the Oho Ocean, known as Oho Oasis, where they learn Firehand and Thunderhand. They make it out of the Oho Ocean and go to the Beanbean International Airport, where Princess Peach is due to fly in. When Peach lands, it is revealed that her voice was never actually stolen, and that Birdo was disguised as Peach. Princess Peach decides to visit immigrant Toads while she is in the Beanbean Kingdom, in the town of Little Fungitown.<br /><br />To get there, they have to travel in Teehee Valley, which is inhabited primarily by monsters. Mario and Luigi, however, manage to escort Peach to Little Fungitown in safety. As the duo is exploring the village, Mario manages to win an Invincishroom, which gives him Bean Fever, a condition which will slowly transform him into a Beanish (the species that are the primary inhabitants of the Beanbean Kingdom). Luigi travels to the Guffawha Ruins (after being hypnotized into thinking he is Mario) and gathers the Crabbie Grass, the only known antidote for the Bean Fever. On his way back to the hospital, however, Cackletta attacks (in Bowser's Koopa Clown Car) and kidnaps Peach. Luigi quickly revives Mario, and the two race back to the castle.<br /><br />It ends up that when Peasley launched Fawful, he landed in the Stardust Fields. Rookie landed here as well (it is revealed that he is an amnesiac Bowser). Fawful puts Cackletta's spirit in Bowser, forming Bowletta. Back at the castle, everyone is gathered. They are surprised by the new state of things, and suddenly they receive a ransom message from Bowletta. She wants the Beanstar in return for Princess Peach. Prince Peasley bets the brothers 99,999,999,999 coins that he will find the Beanstar shards first.<br /><br /><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/886268-gfs_51962_2_70.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-886268\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/886268-gfs_51962_2_70.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-886268\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/886268-gfs_51962_2_70.jpg\"></a><figcaption>S.S. Chuckola</figcaption></figure>The first Beanstar shard is located in the Teehee Valley on the ship S.S. Chuckola. The ship is filled with skeletal sailors, as the ship was sunk many years ago, before the desert dried up. The brothers manage to fill the area up with water again, but as soon as the ship makes it to the Oho Ocean, it sinks. The Beanstar floats out of the ship, and Mario and Luigi follow it to Gwarhar Lagoon. The duo get new abilities from the Jellyfish Sisters here. They find the Beanstar as an ornament on Hermie III. The brothers battle Hermie III, and get the Beanstar shard back.<br /><br />The remaining three shards don't take quite as long to find. One is found with a stylist named Harhall, another is located in the Yoshi Theater and is collected from Boddle after the brothers get all of the Neon Eggs for him, and another one is in the Chucklehuck Woods, at an area known as the Winkle Colosseum (where Popple tries to steal it, but fails). Back at the castle, Lady Lima has another message from Bowletta. Bowletta wants the brothers to bring the Beanstar shards to Joke's End. Prince Peasley had the idea to try and trick Bowletta and Fawful with a Fake Beanstar. They make it to Joke's End, where a girl named Jojora appears. She calls Joke's End her \"playground.\" They eventually find Jojora and defeat her and her friends.<br /><br /><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/886269-fake_beanstar.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-886269\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/886269-fake_beanstar.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-886269\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/886269-fake_beanstar.png\"></a><figcaption>Fake Beanstar</figcaption></figure>After making it to Fawful, Fawful sees right through their Fake Beanstar ploy. He stole the real Beanstar, but Mario comes up with a plan. Toadsworth had given the brothers an extra dress for Princess Peach. Luigi puts on the dress and pretends that they have the fake Princess Peach. Bowletta falls for the ruse this time, and tosses the real Princess Peach out of the Koopa Clown Car, and takes the fake Princess Peach to the Koopa Cruiser. Luigi in the Koopa Cruiser, manages to recapture the Beanstar and escape.<br /><br />Luigi lands in Teehee Valley, and sinks in a sand pit. Mario goes to investigate, and finds him underground, tied up. Popple jumps in with his new \"Rookie,\" Birdo, who has fallen in love with Popple. They beat him and Birdo, and head back to Beanbean Castle Town. Bowletta has attacked the town again, this time leaving it in shambles. She is using Bowser's Castle to attack, which floats in the sky. Mario and Luigi go to Blablanadon in Hoohoo Village to ask him to fly the brothers up to the castle. Once in the castle, the brothers defeat all of the Kooplings, many of Bowser's and Cackletta's minions, and eventually Fawful. After defeating Bowletta, the brothers are brought down to incredibly low health, and Bowletta sucks them in, where they fight Cackletta's spirit. Luckily, the brothers escape the castle before it explodes. The Beanbean Kingdom is free of Cackletta, once and for all.<br /><br /><h3>Characters</h3><h3></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1947/238096-fawful.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-238096\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1947/238096-fawful.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-238096\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1947/238096-fawful.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Fawful</figcaption></figure><br />The game has many unique--and humorous--characters scattered throughout it. The main protagonists, of course, are the titular brothers: Mario and Luigi. They remain silent throughout the entire game, conversing only through comical motions. Bowser is not the main antagonist in this game, instead being a helpful character (until his inevitable possession). Cackletta, the main antagonist, is a witch who is determined to gain world domination. Her sidekick, Fawful, is one of the most humorous characters in the game, known for his use of the phrase, \"I HAVE FURY!\" and such nonsensical lines about condiments. Also encountered on several occasions is a thief named Popple, who is usually attempting to steal the same treasure that the brothers need for their quest.<br /><br />Also helping out the brothers is the royal family of the Beanbean Kingdom: Queen Bean (who is turned into a monster by Cackletta) and Prince Peasley (also transformed into a monster). Prince Peasley is somewhat of a celebrity is the kingdom, and one part of the game focuses around an autograph from him. As with all 2D platforming Mario games, the goal is to rescue Princess Peach.",

It is the sequel to <a href=\"/super-mario-kart/3030-19071/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19071\">Super Mario Kart</a> for the <a href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">SNES</a> and features characters and track locations from the Mario universe. Mario Kart 64 made the leap from <a href=\"/mode-7/3015-184/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-184\">Mode 7</a> to full 3D computer graphics, which allowed for complex track designs. The characters, however, remain 2-dimensional sprites. The game was a huge success, selling millions of copies and eventually became a Player's Choice title.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/118/216925-mario_kart_64.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-216925\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/118/216925-mario_kart_64.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-216925\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/118/216925-mario_kart_64.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Bowser in Mario Kart 64</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Mario Kart 64 can be a simple racer in order to appeal to a casual player, but offers more advanced techniques to keep a more experienced player interested. At its most bare-bones, Mario Kart 64 only requires the player to press the accelerate button to drive and use the analog control stick to control the kart's direction. More experienced players will be able to use <a href=\"/drifting/3015-74/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-74\">drifting</a> and Mario themed weapons and items such as <a href=\"/koopa/3015-120/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-120\">Turtle Shells</a> and <a href=\"/super-mushroom/3055-49/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-49\">Mushroom Boosts</a> to get the advantage over their opponents. Items are scattered in rainbow colored boxes across each track and as the items in each box are random and potentially very powerful, they add a certain level of uncertainty to each race. The drifting mechanic is performed by hopping and turning in mid air which allows a player to take sharp turns without losing speed, and if done correctly one can obtain a speed boost.</p><p style=\"\">The game is separated into four play types, <a href=\"/grand-prix/3015-3962/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3962\">Grand Prix</a>, Versus, Battle, and <a href=\"/time-trials/3015-1361/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1361\">Time Trial</a>. In each of these modes you choose from 16 race tracks and 8 playable racers, each of which have different attributes such as speed, acceleration, and weight. These attributes affect how each character handles. The Grand Prix mode has four difficulties, 50cc, 100cc, 150cc, and Extra, each progressively faster with more difficult opponents, or in the case of Extra, mirrored versions of all of the tracks. The 16 tracks are divided into 4 cups, and you are tasked with racing these cups to win trophies. If you achieve all gold trophies in all the cups in each difficulty, you are rewarded with a new title screen. Versus and Battle mode allow players to compete with up to four of their friends via split screen. Versus allows friends to race together on any of the single player tracks, and battle allow players to fight in large arenas using items. Time Trial has a player racing against the clock. This mode will display a \" ghost\" of your best time, which is a translucent recording of your previous best lap.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p style=\"\">The playable characters are:</p><h3>Lightweight</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/601/235050-21377.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-235050\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/601/235050-21377.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-235050\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/601/235050-21377.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Player select screen</figcaption></figure><ul><li><a href=\"/toad/3005-845/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-845\">Toad</a></li><li><a href=\"/peach/3005-709/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-709\">Princess Peach</a></li><li><a href=\"/yoshi/3005-700/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-700\">Yoshi</a></li></ul><h3>Middleweight</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Mario</a></li><li><a href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\">Luigi</a></li></ul><h3>Heavyweight</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/donkey-kong/3005-299/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-299\">Donkey Kong</a></li><li><a href=\"/wario/3005-24/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24\">Wario</a></li><li><a href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-337\">Bowser</a></li></ul><p style=\"\">Lightweight racers have quick acceleration and excellent handling, but have slow top speeds and are easily knocked around.

While the film was universally panned by movie critics and video gamers alike, it was successful in its ulterior purpose of promoting Super Mario Bros. 3.</p><p style=\"\">Super Mario Bros. 3 is generally considered to be one of the <a href=\"../../nes/93-2794/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nintendo Entertainment System's</a> best, one of the greatest Nintendo games of all time, and also one of the best <a href=\"../../mario/62-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mario</a> games ever created. It was noted for being the top selling video game of all time, before being surpassed by <a href=\"/wii-sports/3030-13328/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13328\">Wii Sports</a>.</p><p style=\"\">The game's popularity has resulted in a few ports and remakes, including <a href=\"/super-mario-all-stars/3030-18529/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18529\">Super Mario All-Stars</a> (a compilation of early Mario games), <a href=\"/super-mario-bros-3-super-mario-advance-4/3030-20748/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20748\">Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3</a>, and a <a href=\"/virtual-console/3015-2925/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2925\">Virtual Console</a> port.</p><p style=\"\"><a href=\"/shigeru-miyamoto/3040-614/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-614\">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> returned as lead designer along with <a href=\"/takashi-tezuka/3040-593/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-593\">Takashi Tezuka</a>, and <a href=\"/koji-kondo/3040-606/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-606\">Koji Kondo</a> as the game's music composer.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3957/203767-ss_smb3_nes.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-203767\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3957/203767-ss_smb3_nes.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-203767\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3957/203767-ss_smb3_nes.gif\"></a><figcaption>Super Mario Bros. 3 brings back the series' traditional gameplay</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The gameplay in Super Mario Bros. 3 is more akin to the original <a href=\"../../super-mario-bros/61-15544/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Super Mario Bros.</a> than the deviation found in <a href=\"/super-mario-bros-2/3030-7406/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7406\">Super Mario Bros. 2</a>. The game also expands on and introduces many new concepts, some of which stayed for future Mario titles. Notably, Super Mario Bros. 3 was the first Mario game to feature a <a href=\"/world-map/3015-611/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-611\">world map</a>, allowing the player a certain level of freedom, including the occasional opportunity to skip sections of levels.</p><p style=\"\">The game follows the traditional formula of <a href=\"../../mario/94-177/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mario</a> chasing down <a href=\"../../bowser/94-337/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bowser</a> to rescue the kidnapped <a href=\"../../peach/94-709/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Princess Peach</a>, though this time around Mario also has to deal with Bowser's children and their powerful <a href=\"/airship/3055-154/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-154\">airships</a>.</p><p style=\"\">Because of the new world map, certain areas are blocked by <a href=\"../../hammer-bros/92-783/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hammer Bros.</a>, which Mario must defeat (or he can put them to sleep using an item found in the game). Along with these dangerous obstacles, there are <a href=\"/minigames/3015-116/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-116\">minigames</a> found in a <a href=\"../../toad/94-845/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Toad</a>'s house. The minigames allow Mario to win items such as Super Mushrooms that can be stored in a bar at the bottom of the screen for future use in individual levels.</p><p style=\"\">Super Mario Bros. 3 also includes a simultaneous multiplayer mode. Player one controls Mario while player two controls <a href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\">Luigi</a>, as the two traverse the game's eight worlds. Through this mode, even more minigames are accessible, including a retouched version of the original <a href=\"/mario-bros/3030-19726/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19726\">Mario Bros</a>.</p><h2>Worlds</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15051/453906-8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-453906\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15051/453906-8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-453906\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15051/453906-8.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Grass Land gets things started.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>Grass Land</b> (World One) - Grass Land is a basic Mario world, featuring a mix of slightly varied Mario environments such as straightforward outdoor stages, auto-scrolling stages that take place in the air, and even an underground stage. It is the smallest world in the game, its map taking up only one screen.</li><li><b>Desert Land</b> (World Two) - A desert world, as the name implies. Quicksand becomes a common obstacle, and one stage takes place inside of a pyramid.</li><li><b>Water Land</b> (World Three) - This world takes place next to the ocean. Levels begin to take place underwater, and even levels that are not underwater usually feature water of some kind.</li><li><b>Giant Land</b> (World Four) - Giant Land is very similar to Grass Land. The difference is that enemies and objects are all more than twice their normal size! Even so, most of them can be destroyed with the same amount of effort.</li><li><b>Sky Land</b> (World Five) - The first half of sky land is also similar to Grass Land. However, the tower stage that exists at the midpoint of this level will take Mario up into the sky, which means that the latter half of this world is composed mostly of air stages.</li><li><b>Ice Land</b> (World Six) - Ice Land's stages are all covered in ice. Mario will slip on ice if he is not carefully controlled, making control even more important than ever.</li><li><b>Pipe Land</b> (World Seven) - Pipe Land's stages feature an abundance of pipes! While the environments may be similar to Grass Land, pipes are absolutely everywhere in these stages, and Piranha Plants come with them.</li><li><b>Dark Land</b> (World Eight) - Dark Land features many stages that are similar to the auto-scrolling airship stages that end the other worlds. It does eventually feature a few \"normal\" stages that resemble earlier worlds, but even these appear to take place at night. Watch out, because nearly every enemy in the game can appear at any time. At the end waits Bowser's Castle.</li></ul><h2>Power-Ups</h2><p style=\"\">Super Mario Bros. 3 brings back the old powers from the first game, and it also adds some new, more abstract upgrades.</p><h4><a href=\"../../super-mushroom/93-49/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Super Mushroom</a></h4><p style=\"\">The classic Super Mario Bros. item returns in Super Mario Bros. 3. It turns Mario into Super Mario, allowing him to take one more hit before he dies.</p><h4><a href=\"../../fire-flower/93-10/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fire Flower</a></h4><p style=\"\">The Fire Flower is another classic Super Mario Bros. item. It gives Mario the ability to shoot fireballs and quickly destroy enemies. If he is hurt, Mario reverts to his Super Mario stage.</p><h4><a href=\"../../raccoon-suit/93-1246/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Raccoon Suit</a></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/958/178716-tanooki_mario.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-178716\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/958/178716-tanooki_mario.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-178716\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/958/178716-tanooki_mario.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Tanooki Suit</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">A new item, this gives Mario the ability to fly for short periods of time. If he runs for a while and gets his P-Meter high up, Mario can soar through the sky. Pressing B makes Mario spin, which slows down his descent and hits enemies that get whacked by the raccoon tail.</p><h4><a href=\"../../frog-suit/93-40/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Frog Suit</a></h4><p style=\"\">The Frog Suit is another new item, giving Mario the ability to swim faster in the water. However, he hops around on land, making him harder to control.</p><h4><a href=\"../../tanooki-suit/93-38/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tanooki Suit</a></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2986/559569-hammer_suit.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-559569\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2986/559569-hammer_suit.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-559569\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2986/559569-hammer_suit.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Hammer Bro. Suit</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Very similar to the Raccoon Suit, this item allows Mario to turn into a stone statue, making him invincible to enemies. In addition to that, it has all of the abilities of the Raccoon Suit.</p><h4><a href=\"../../hammer-bros-suit/93-1247/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hammer Bro. Suit</a></h4><p style=\"\">The Hammer Bro. Suit gives Mario the ability to throw hammers. Mario can also go into the shell and protect himself from enemies.</p><h4><a href=\"../../kuribos-shoe/93-12/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kuribo's Shoe</a></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4/10565-shoe.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-10565\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4/10565-shoe.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-10565\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4/10565-shoe.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Kuribo's Shoe</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">A unique power-up, this allows Mario to stomp around in a giant Goomba's shoe. He is impervious to attack from below while he is in Kuribo's Shoe, like Piranha Plants. It is only available in level 5-3. The shoe has not appeared as a power up in any game since Super Mario Bros. 3</p><h4><a href=\"../../starman/93-23/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Starman</a></h4><p style=\"\">Another classic Super Mario Bros. power-up, this makes Mario temporarily invincible. In certain levels, Mario can string Starmen one after the other to the end of a level by hitting the right blocks along the way before running out of invincibility.</p><h4><a href=\"/warp-whistle/3055-468/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-468\">Warp Whistle</a></h4><p style=\"\">A rare power-up that could only be found in some areas, this lets Mario skip a world at any time, mimicking the pipe zones from the first game. Mario can only move between tiers of levels in this way, so the tiers were: Worlds 2-4, Worlds 5-7, and World 8.</p><h2>Bowser's Children</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/2163988-Koopalings7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2163988\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/2163988-Koopalings7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2163988\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/2163988-Koopalings7.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">Bowser's seven children are the bosses of each world preceding World Eight (Dark Land), in which the player faces Bowser himself. Each child is actually named after a famous musician. Each Koopa is felled after three hits.</p><h4><a href=\"/larry-koopa/3005-2289/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2289\">Larry Koopa</a></h4><p style=\"\">Larry has no real special abilities beyond jumping high after taking two hits. He is the boss of Grass Land. It is uncertain who Larry is actually named after, but it is speculated to be Lawrence Welk, a well-known accordionist.</p><h4><a href=\"/morton-koopa-jr/3005-2271/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2271\">Morton Koopa, Jr.</a></h4><p style=\"\">Morton is the boss of Desert Land, and the second youngest of the <a href=\"/koopalings/3015-3991/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3991\">Koopalings</a>. He is loud-mouthed and hot-tempered. While his facial features (the star on his left eye) resemble those of KISS member <a href=\"/paul-stanley/3040-48671/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-48671\">Paul Stanley</a>, Morton is actually named after Morton Downey, Jr. (which also explains the \"Jr.\" in Morton's name, not insinuating that Bowser's real name is Morton).</p><h4><a href=\"/wendy-o-koopa/3005-2260/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2260\">Wendy O. Koopa</a></h4><p style=\"\">Wendy is the only female Koopaling, and also the only Koopaling to have completely circular magical attacks. She is the third youngest, and is often portrayed as a whiny, spoiled brat. Wendy is named after Wendy O. Williams, the singer for the band The Plasmatics.</p><h4><a href=\"/iggy-koopa/3005-2308/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2308\">Iggy Koopa</a></h4><p style=\"\">Iggy is the middle child of the Koopalings. He is considered a \"genius,\" particularly in the cartoons, where he is twin brothers with Lemmy Koopa. His in-game representation differs from his artwork, in which he sports a rainbow mohawk. In-game, he lacks this, and only has a blonde tuft of hair. Iggy is named after the influential punk artist <a href=\"/iggy-pop/3040-62826/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-62826\">Iggy Pop</a>.</p><h4><a href=\"/roy-koopa/3005-2324/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2324\">Roy Koopa</a></h4><p style=\"\">Roy is the third oldest Koopaling. He is a bully, and enjoys seeing others' pain. He is the largest of the Koopalings, and thus, the worst at jumping. However, when he lands, he causes a ground-shaking blast, which stuns the player if they are still on the ground. Roy is based on Roy Orbison, who inspired Roy Koopa's shades.</p><h4><a href=\"/lemmy-koopa/3005-2337/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2337\">Lemmy Koopa</a></h4><p style=\"\">Lemmy is the only Koopaling to ride around on a green ball.

Mario Party 2 was released on January 24, 2000 in North America, December 17, 1999 in Japan, October 12, 2000 in Europe, and November 6, 2000 in Australia. The game was developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-419\" href=\"/hudson-entertainment-inc/3010-419/\">Hudson Soft</a> and published by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\">Nintendo</a> (as with every other game in the franchise besides <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14770\" href=\"/mario-party-e/3030-14770/\">Mario Party-e</a>). Mario Party 2 was generally well-received from critics, garnering an average review score of 76% from Game Rankings. The game was criticized for not differing much from its <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6424\" href=\"/mario-party/3030-6424/\">predecessor</a>, however.<br /><br />The plot of the game involves <a data-ref-id=\"3005-177\" href=\"/mario/3005-177/\">Mario</a> and his friends creating a world called \"Mario Land,\" but then <a data-ref-id=\"3005-24\" href=\"/wario/3005-24/\">Wario</a> wants to call the world \"Wario Land.\" They begin arguing over the name, with other characters introducing their own names. As this is happening, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-337\" href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\">Bowser</a> decides to try and invade the world. Whoever can defeat Bowser will get the world named after them.<br /><br /><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6393/410695-foto_mario_party_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-410695\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6393/410695-foto_mario_party_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-410695\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6393/410695-foto_mario_party_2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>One of the game's many four player minigames.</figcaption></figure>The goal of Mario Party 2 is to gather the most stars before the end of the game. To do this, players are placed on a game board (similar to that of a real life board game) in which they travel spaces each turn, gathering coins and items to the ultimate goal of a star. Coins can also be gathered by participating in minigames. The winner is presented with a set amount of coins, while the losers are rewarded with nothing.<br /><br />Mario Party 2 has several new features. Each character (Mario, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-370\" href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\">Luigi</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-709\" href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709/\">Princess Peach</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-700\" href=\"/yoshi/3005-700/\">Yoshi</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-24\" href=\"/wario/3005-24/\">Wario</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-299\" href=\"/donkey-kong/3005-299/\">Donkey Kong</a>) has a costume unique to each game board. So, depending on which board the game is on, the costume for the character changes to that certain theme. For example, if the players are in Space Land, then the characters will be dressed in space-related attire.<br /><br />The game also adds new spaces to the game board. In addition to adding buildings (which have their own spaces on the game board), Mario Party 2 adds a Battle Space, Item Space, and Bank Space. The battle space will trigger a battle minigame, which are introduced in this game. The item space begins a minigame that allows the player to win an item. The bank space opens up the Koopa Bank, giving whoever stepped on the bank space all coins currently in the bank.<br /><br />The minigames are what the Mario Party franchise is most known for. In addition to introducing the battle minigames, Mario Party 2 contains four player minigames, two versus two minigames, one versus three minigames, item minigames (triggered by the item space), and duel minigames. Four player minigames pit all four players into a free-for-all, two versus two is a team game with randomly selected teams, one versus three pits one player with an advantage versus the other three, and duel minigames are minigames between two players.<br />",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Mario Teaches Typing was an edutainment video game released for computer only in 1992. Nintendo licensed the likeness of the main characters from the Mario Bros. franchise. The game was a contemporary to many grade school typing trainers such as PAWS Typing. The game displays the total test time and words per minute to the user in real time. A summary of the level is given, either graduating players to the next stage, or having them repeat the level due to poor performance.</p><p style=\"\">This game featured a floating Mario head that would occasionally talk to you and either crack jokes or give his opinions on certain matters regarding typing at the main menu.</p><h2>Game Design</h2><p style=\"\">Several familiar Mario Bros. levels are present in Mario Teaches Typing. Three separate lesson styles cover three separate areas of the Mushroom Kingdom, including the opening level to the original Super Mario Bros., an underwater level, and Bowser’s Castle, complete with Thwomps.</p><p style=\"\">The first beginner level is named \"Mario's Smash and Dash\". Turtles, which resemble classic Koopas, and brick blocks each have a symbol corresponding to a key on the keyboard which the player must correctly type. Mario then either jumps on the turtle or smashes the block, progressing to the next letter. Mario only moves when the correct key is pressed, otherwise he is left standing stationary, while the turtles and blocks creep towards his position. During this stage, failure does not cause the level to end, only requiring the stage to be repeated.</p><p style=\"\">The underwater level is occupied with familiar looking squids and fish, while Mario keeps swimming while the player is typing. In this stage, the player must complete sequences of letters designed to train the hands to type in the proper position. Failure to keep up with the pacing of the level causes Mario to sink below the screen and lose a life.</p><p style=\"\">The final stage, dubbed \"Mario's Tunnel of Doom\", features Bowser’s Castle, where Thwomps and pits pose threats to Mario. The player must type full sentences seen at the top of the screen, which relate to American history. Again, if the player is unable to keep up with the pace of the level, Mario loses a life and the stage must be reset.</p><p style=\"\">An additional lesson, named Mario's Expert Express, displays a full screen page of text, with Mario’s face on the top of the page. Players must copy the text letter for letter, with the only visual feedback of progress being the facial expression of Mario. Mario gives a very large smile when players have a high words per minute with low errors. Conversely, Mario will frown at the player when many mistakes are made.</p><p style=\"\">After each lesson is complete (excluding Mario's Expert Express), provided that the player reaches their goal WPM target, a cut scene plays building onto the usual story of the Mario Bros. rescuing the princess.</p><p style=\"\">Unlike many Mario games at the time, Mario is not the only character players can select. They may also select from Luigi and Princess Toadstool as well.</p>",

The title was designed as a definitive collection of four previous Mario titles that had been released on the original <a href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">NES</a>. Thanks to the enhanced capabilities of the SNES over its predecessor, each of the Mario games appeared with graphical face lifts, adding more detailed graphics and animation, as well as remixed soundtracks.

It wasn't released in North America until its inclusion in Super Mario All-Stars. The North American Super Mario Bros. 2, a heavily modified and redesigned version of the game <a href=\"/yume-kojo-doki-doki-panic/3030-21469/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21469\">Yume Kojo: Doki Doki Panic</a>, had previously been released in Japan under the name Super Mario USA. As a proper sequel built from the foundation set by the original Super Mario Bros., The Lost Levels contains many of the same design aesthetics and gameplay aspects, but with a much greater degree of challenge. It also removed the option of a two-player game but allowed players to play as either <a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Mario</a> or <a href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\">Luigi</a>, and gave the brothers different abilities.

The game was notable as it was the only way to play the updated versions of the games on the Wii. (The virtual console version of the games are just ports of the NES version) In addition to the game, the package also included a thirty-two page booklet containing artwork and comments from Nintendo staff members and a CD containing tracks from games ranging from the original Super Mario Bros. to <a href=\"/super-mario-galaxy-2/3030-26839/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26839\">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>. The album also contains ten original sound effects and short music clips from the original game, including the coin-collection sound effect, the power up/power down sounds, and the <a href=\"/game-over/3015-372/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-372\">Game Over</a> theme.

Mario Kart Wii ships with the Wii Wheel, a plastic shell designed to hold the Wii Remote and act as a unique gimmick control for the game, which went through at least 30 different iterations before a final design was decided upon. Another \"new feature\" is the removal of a feature previously added in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-18757\" href=\"/mario-kart-double-dash/3030-18757/\" slug=\"mario-kart-double-dash\"><i>Mario Kart: Double Dash!!</i></a>, which was the addition of unique items for each character; since these weapons are now gone, all the characters in the same weight category play identically, creating a less dynamic, more homogeneous race experience.</p><h2>Game Modes</h2><p style=\"\">In Mario Kart Wii, there are four standard mode of gameplay. With the exception of Time Trials and Grand Prix which only holds one person, all modes can be played in local multiplayer with up to four people at once.</p><h3>Grand Prix</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70944/1252055-1056221_mushroom_gorgec.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1252055\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70944/1252055-1056221_mushroom_gorgec.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1252055\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/70944/1252055-1056221_mushroom_gorgec.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Toadette is ready to go as the countdown to the GP race is about to begin.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The standard single-player Mario Kart mode. Here, players compete in races facing 11 CPU opponents at once, a step up of four from previous Mario Kart games which maxed out at seven opponents per race. There are four modes of competition: 50cc (<a data-ref-id=\"3055-552\" href=\"/go-kart/3055-552/\" slug=\"go-kart\">Karts</a> only), 100cc (Bikes only), 150cc, and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2975\" href=\"/mirror-mode/3015-2975/\" slug=\"mirror-mode\">Mirror Mode</a> - the last of which only opens up when a player completes all circuits of all previous classes. Players can also switch the first two classes to Karts and Bikes once they beat all the circuits. As always in every <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3962\" href=\"/grand-prix/3015-3962/\" slug=\"grand-prix\">GP</a> mode, players start the first race of the cup at the back of the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3028\" href=\"/starting-grid/3015-3028/\" slug=\"starting-grid\">grid</a> and just like in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6539\" href=\"/mario-kart-ds/3030-6539/\" slug=\"mario-kart-ds\">Mario Kart DS</a>, players can <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1823\" href=\"/rocket-start/3015-1823/\" slug=\"rocket-start\">rocket start</a> by pressing the gas button during the countdown before the green light on <a data-ref-id=\"3005-927\" href=\"/lakitu/3005-927/\" slug=\"lakitu\">Lakitu</a>'s <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1987\" href=\"/lakitus-start-signal/3055-1987/\" slug=\"lakitus-start-signal\">signal</a> goes off.

With more racers, the point system has increased. First place gives the player fifteen points, twelve for second place, ten for third, and so forth. After all four races are played, an award ceremony is being held for the three best drivers and players are given a ranking from E to 3 Stars in addition to the trophy for winning the cup.</p><h3>Time Trials</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27545/966472-mk4_156.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-966472\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27545/966472-mk4_156.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-966472\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27545/966472-mk4_156.jpg\"></a><figcaption>A Time Trial run at Rainbow Road with Mario.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Here players compete for the fastest time possible in each course.

      "deck": "The Game Boy Color version of Mario Golf includes an extensive single player RPG campaign unlike any other Mario Golf game.",
      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">The Game Boy Color version of Mario Golf was developed by Camelot, who also developed the Nintendo 64 version. Both games were released within the same year in 1999 and share the same golf gameplay mechanics. However, the Game Boy Color version provides a different player experience than its console counterpart by providing a single-player RPG-like campaign.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Golf Shot on Course</h3><p style=\"\">Before the player goes into the mode where they perform the shot, the can indicate where the shot will go by moving the arrow cursor on the course. Players may also choose to use a power shot to increase the distance of their shot, or use approach shots if they are within 60 yards of the pin. Once the player is satisfied with the power and location, they move on to the phase where the golf swing is performed.</p><p style=\"\">Mario Golf uses a three-button power gauge scheme to determine the distance and destination of the golf shot. The first button starts the golf swing by having a white bar moving left along the gauge on the bottom of the screen. The second button places a mark along the gauge to determine the power of the shot. The farther left the marker is placed on the gauge, the longer the shot will go. The final button places the mark along the \"contact zone\" of the gauge. The closer the marker is to the white line and within the red line of the contact zone, the closer the shot will land at the desired location.</p><h4>Special Shots</h4><p style=\"\"><strong>Power</strong>: The player is allotted six power shots to use over an 18-hole golf course. Power shots can be retained by attaining a \"nice shot\", where the markers for distance toward the far left of the gauge and accuracy on the middle of the contact zone are perfectly marked. If the player fails to perfectly mark either the distance or accuracy portion of the swing, the power shot is used up.</p><p style=\"\"><b>Approach</b>: The shot is available when the ball is within 60 yards of the pin. The player can choose between a 30-yard and a 60-yard approach shot.</p><h4>Spins</h4><p style=\"\">During the three-button phase of the golf swing, the player can add spin to their shot by holding the directional pad over the entire swing process.</p><ul><li>Up: Topspin. The ball will roll forward as it lands.</li><li>Down: Backspin. The ball will roll backwards as it lands.</li><li>Left/Right: Curve. The shot will curve once it is struck. Holding the pad left will have the shot start left, then curve right, vice versa for holding the pad right.</li></ul><h3>Golf Shot on Green</h3><p style=\"\">Likewise, the player can locate where they want to aim the putt and determine which power range to use before they head to the swing portion. The game displays arrows of differing sizes and directions to indicate the severity of the slope on the green.</p><p style=\"\">Two buttons are used to determine the distance of the putt. The first button starts the swing. The second button places a mark on the gauge to determine the power of the putt. The farther left the mark is placed on the gauge, the farther the putt will go.</p><h2>Main Character Creation</h2><p style=\"\">Mario Golf offers a couple of options for the player to create their character to use for all the playable modes in the game. Three slots are available for the player to create different main characters.</p><p style=\"\">First Selection - Gender: Male or Female</p><p style=\"\">Second Selection - Age: Young Golfer or Adult Golfer</p><p style=\"\">Third Selection - Hand Preference: Right-Handed or Left-Handed</p><h3>Main Character Attributes</h3><p style=\"\">All main characters have four attributes that the player can improve upon when they accumulate enough experience points to reach the next level. The player can select one attribute to improve upon once they pass a level. However, at each level, whichever attribute that is not selected has that attribute deteriorate in quality.</p><p style=\"\"><strong>Drive</strong> - The 1W normal power distance for the MC.</p><ul><li>Improvement: The MC's 1W drive improves 2-3 yards.</li></ul><p style=\"\"><strong>Height</strong> - The height of the MC's golf shot. Ranges from mid-lo (best) to mid-high (worst).</p><ul><li>Improvement: The MC's height is decreased toward mid-lo.</li><li>Decrease: The MC's height in increased, causing it to be more affected by strong wings.</li></ul><p style=\"\"><strong>Shot</strong> - The player's golf shot style. Ranges from straight (best) to extreme fade or draw (worst).</p><ul><li>Improvement: The MC's shot is less extreme in fade or draw, the best being a straight shot as the player can easily aim where to target their shot on course.</li><li>Decrease: The MC's shot is more fade or draw, where the shot starts off to the left in a fade, or right in a draw, then curves back. However, the fade or draw shot can be affected by crosswinds, causing the shot to land elsewhere than the intended destination.</li></ul><p style=\"\"><strong>Meet Area and Control</strong> - The MC's \"contact zone\" during the three-button phase of the golf swing. Ranges from wide and good (best) to narrow and poor (worst).</p><ul><li>Improvement: The MC's contact zone is widened and their shot control is improved. The increased contact zone allows the player to still shoot a good shot if they don't hit the center mark of the zone.</li><li>Decrease: The MC's contact zone is narrowed and their shot control gets worse. The narrowed contact zone increases the player's likelihood to hit a poor shot if they miss hitting the final portion of the swing in the zone.</li></ul><h2>World Map</h2><p style=\"\">The main campaign of Mario Golf features a world map that includes all four clubhouses and Peach's Castle once the player unlocks that location, along with other locales that provide special shot challenges for the player to partake. Each clubhouse has a driving, approach, and putting ranges that contain gameplay tips and contests.

      "description": "<p style=\"\">Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Mini-Land Mayhem is the fourth game in the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1354\" href=\"/mario-vs-donkey-kong/3025-1354/\" slug=\"mario-vs-donkey-kong\">         Mario vs. Donkey Kong</a> series. It was released in North America on November 14, 2010 and will be released in Japan on December 2, 2010.<br/></p><h2>Story</h2>It's the grand opening of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-177\" href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" slug=\"mario\">        Mario</a>'s new amusement park, and he is giving away Pauline toys to the first 100 guests. Arriving as the 101st guest, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-299\" href=\"/donkey-kong/3005-299/\" slug=\"donkey-kong\">      Donkey Kong</a> misses out on a toy and instead kidnaps the real <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1246\" href=\"/pauline/3005-1246/\" slug=\"pauline\">       Pauline</a>. Mario then chases after Donkey Kong with his army of Mini toys.<br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2>Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Mini-Land Mayhem plays like the previous games in the series. The difference is that you don't have direct control over the Mini-Marios this time around, except starting them. The game is more focused on making a path to the goal for them by making bridges, placing springs etc.  Guide them all to the exit door to clear the area.  Unlike the previous game, you have to make a combo chain thorugh the door with all Mini-Marios, too slow and the door is blocked resulting in a Game Over.  <br/>This game, unlike the previous game also, will not tolerate any destroyed mini-Marios, if one is hit, it's game over.<br/> <br/>Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Mini-Land Mayhem is broken up into 8 stages (Attractions), plus  Special stages and Expert stages as well as a plus mode.  Each has a theme that unifies the areas on each stage. Stages consist of 8 areas, a boss battle and a mini game. The 4th and 8th areas are special because they feature an extra mechanic. The 4th area of each stage is a mulitdoor one where you not only have to lead Mini-Mario to his door, but a mini-Toad, mini-Peach, mini-DK and mini-Pauline as well, each of them has their own door they need to enter to complete the stage, the 8th areas requires that the sole mini-Mario with a key attached to him is the first to enter the goal door before the other Marios can walk through it. <br/>  <br/>This game also features \"MINI GUIDE\" similar to the Super Guide in most recent Nintendo games, it appear on the Game Over screen after losing a area enough times.<br/>After the main game you can try Plus Mode which will make you tackle the same stages, but requires you to guide your marching toys into the goal door in a specfic order, not doing so will result in game over.   <br/> <br/><h3>Mini-Mario's behavior:</h3><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>He always start by standing still, tap him or remove the solid floor under him and he will start walking in the direction he is facing.   <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/111937/1739748-mdkmlmboss_620x.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1739748\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/111937/1739748-mdkmlmboss_620x.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1739748\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/111937/1739748-mdkmlmboss_620x.jpg\"></a><figcaption> A typical boss battle, players must guide the Marios to the three switches while avoiding barrels.</figcaption></figure> </li><li>Hitting walls will make him go the opposite direction.</li><li>If a walking Mini-Mario touch another Mini-Mario not yet activated, he will activate him too and they will both walk in the same direction. <br/></li><li>If two already activated Mini-Mario bounce into each others, they both turn to the opposite direction.<br/></li><li>He can jump up one-block tall edges.</li><li>When in midair, he always fall straight down.</li><li>Mini-Mario can't survive a long fall.</li><li>Mini-Mario will use goal doors, pipes, springs, ladders and so on automatically when close to them.<br/></li></ul> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/><h2>Construction Zone</h2>Construction zone makes a return and is similar to the one in the previous game. You can submit you creations online and download others.<br/><u> </u>Once you complete a attraction in the main game, you can use that attractions theme and tools in the construction zone.<br/><h2>Controls</h2>Much of the game is controlled with the stylus.   <br/> <br/>Stylus Controls:   <br/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Tapping on a mini will activate the mini at which point it will continue to walk forward until it hits an object and turns around.</li><li>Slide the stylus from one rivet to another will create a girder. You can create either beam girders (from red rivets) or conveyor belts (from purple rivets)<br/></li><li>Place, remove springs, moveable pipes and wooden blocks.</li><li>Create/ remove ladders between two blue rivets vertically.</li></ul> <br/>Button Controls: <br/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>up, down, left, right - scroll around the screen</li><li>A, B, X, Y - scroll around the screen</li><li>Left Trigger - Display help mode</li><li>Right Trigger - Display map</li></ul> <br/><h2>Collectables </h2>Mini-Mario's can collect these things in within a area:<br/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><u><b>M-Coin</b></u>: There is one in each area in a tricky spot,  you can also win up to three of these in each mini-game.

      "description": "<h2> Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">The basic gameplay in Minis on the Move revolves around using the stylus to place various tiles on each level, creating a path for the Minis (tiny wind-up versions of your favorite Mario characters) from the starting point to the goal. Once they start moving, they don't stop until they reach the goal, or don't have a valid path to walk on (either from a lack of a tile being placed, or an incorrectly placed tile), in which case it's game over. Simply getting to the goal can be easy enough, but the real challenge lies in gathering up all the tokens strewn around the level while also making it to the goal in under the allotted time.</p><h2>Game Modes</h2><p style=\"\">There are 4 main modes in Minis on the Move:</p><ul><li><strong>Mario's Main Event:</strong> This is the base mode. As time passes, tiles show up on the right side of the bottom screen, but your queue can only hold up to 5 tiles before it's game over. However, there are ways to eliminate placed tiles (using a bomb) or throw them away immediately (using a trash can tile). Get Mario to the goal!</li><li><strong>Puzzle Palace: </strong>In this mode, you have a fixed set of tiles provided to you, so planning is key.</li><li><strong>Many Mini Mayhem:  </strong>Here there are multiple Minis to keep track of, but all the tiles have already been placed on the board. The player interaction involves rotating tiles by tapping them with the stylus.</li><li><strong>Giant Jungle: </strong>This mode is unique in that there are far fewer levels, but they are huge. Each level has 10 collectibles (instead of the normal 3), and the map needs to be scrolled along using the Circle Pad to view the entirety of it.</li></ul><p style=\"\">Additionally, there are various mini-games, as well as a level creator that allows the player to download and share custom user-created levels.</p>",

All four characters can be used in single-player mode or together as a team in co-op multiplayer.</p><p style=\"\">Super Mario 3D World also offers new power-ups. One is the Cat Suit, which turns its wearer into a cat-like acrobat who can run up walls and pounce around.

It gets activated by collecting a golden bell in the level which causes the character to go from walking upright to crawling on all fours. This suit greatly enhances the move set by allowing players to climb up obstacles, do a pounce attack and various other little things that greatly influence the way in which they can approach a level.</p><h4 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Bullet Block</h4><p style=\"\">The Bullet Block is hidden inside a regular block that gets stuck on the player character's head after which they can then shoot bullets in the direction they're looking.</p><h4 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Double Cherry</h4><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2553787\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2553787-10040423625_014e97faf0_o.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"left\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2553787-10040423625_014e97faf0_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2553787\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2553787-10040423625_014e97faf0_o.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">The Double Cherry is yet another homage to Super Mario Bros. 2 as the cherries were a collectible item in that game. However, in Super Mario 3D World, the Double Cherry lets the players clone themselves. It is unclear what the max amount of clones is but in multiplayer, every character will be able to have at least one clone making the minimum amount eight player characters on screen. The clones mirror the player movements and abilities 1:1 so that when they pick up a power up, all clones of that character will also receive that power up.</p><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Returning Power Ups</h3><ul><li style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\"><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/super-mushroom/3055-49/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-49\">Super Mushroom</a></li><li style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\"><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/mega-mushroom/3055-999/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-999\">Mega Mushroom</a></li><li style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\"><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/tanooki-suit/3055-38/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-38\">Tanooki Suit</a></li><li style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\"><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/fire-flower/3055-10/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-10\">Fire Flower</a></li><li style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Boomerang Suit</li><li style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\"><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/starman/3055-23/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-23\">Starman</a></li><li style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Coin Block</li><li style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Propeller Block</li></ul><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">World Map</h2><p style=\"\">Super Mario 3D World features a fully explorable world map that is based on those world maps found in New Super Mario Bros.

Pressing the A Button allows Mario to jump, and for the first time in the Super Mario series, he can perform actions such as a wall jump, a jumping backflip, and a running triple jump.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1171134-super_mario_64__u___snap0004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1171134\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1171134-super_mario_64__u___snap0004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1171134\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4527/1171134-super_mario_64__u___snap0004.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Mario performing a backflip.</figcaption></figure><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1171137-inset3_09_0213_friday13th.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1171137\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1171137-inset3_09_0213_friday13th.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1171137\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4527/1171137-inset3_09_0213_friday13th.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Mario going for a swim.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>Walking</b> - Press the analog stick gently in the desired direction.</li><li><b>Running</b> - Press the analog stick all the way in the desired direction.</li><li><b>Wall Hug</b> - Hold the analog stick at the same angle as the wall to slide along it.</li><li><a href=\"/jump/3015-379/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-379\"><b>Jump</b></a> - Press A to jump.</li><li><a href=\"/double-jump/3015-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1\"><b>Double Jump</b></a> - Press A to jump and then again after returning to the ground to jump higher than the first jump.</li><li><a href=\"/triple-jump/3015-1565/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1565\"><b>Triple Jump</b></a> - Same as double jump but with a third jump added after returning to the ground.

When Bowser is destroyed, Mario is awarded with a giant star and Princess Peach is rescued.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Items</h2><p style=\"\">Super Mario 64 excludes many of the franchise's classic items, such as the <a href=\"/super-mushroom/3055-49/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-49\">super mushroom</a> and <a href=\"/fire-flower/3055-10/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-10\">fire flower</a>, in favor of special hats that give Mario unique abilities for a limited time. These caps include the metal cap that make him invulnerable and able to walk on the ocean floor, the vanish cap that allows him to pass through certain barriers, and the wing cap that lets him fly.</p><p style=\"\">However, some classic Mario items do make a return. These include the <a href=\"/1-up/3055-77/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-77\">1-up mushroom</a>, <a href=\"/koopa-shell/3055-309/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-309\">Koopa shell</a>, and collectible <a href=\"/coin/3055-219/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-219\">coins</a>, though the functions of coins and shells are different compared to previous Super Mario games. In Super Mario 64, Koopa shells are rare and can be used to surf across the ground and destroy enemies, while collecting coins can restore Mario's health gauge. There are also three types of coins, yellow, blue, and red, worth one, two, and five health points respectively. Additionally, each world contains eight red coins, and collecting all eight during one visit earns Mario a power star.</p><h2>Development</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12044/313288-superm24.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-313288\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12044/313288-superm24.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-313288\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12044/313288-superm24.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Super Mario 64 CG artwork</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a href=\"/shigeru-miyamoto/3040-614/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-614\">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> began work on a 3D iteration of the Mario franchise after working on <a href=\"/star-fox/3030-3984/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3984\">Star Fox</a> for the <a href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a>. For a time he considered developing it for the Super Nintendo, but later decided to develop it for the <a href=\"/nintendo-64/3045-43/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-43\">Nintendo 64</a> due to the limitations of the SNES's hardware. The team spent many of the first months developing the camera and how the gameplay would work.</p><p style=\"\">Originally the game levels were to be linear, but it was later decided that they should be open, free-roaming environments. However, the concept of linear levels can still be seen in final game in the <a href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-337\">Bowser</a> levels, which require Mario to traverse a set path of obstacles to reach Bowser's lair. The development team prioritized making Mario's movements feel fluid and natural.</p><p style=\"\">Before any levels were created, they tested his movements in a simple grid level which featured a golden bunny named \"MIPS\". This character later made an appearance in the final game. When the levels were finally designed, they incorporated more <a href=\"/puzzles/3015-932/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-932\">puzzles</a> than was typically associated with Mario games. This is probably because <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/3030-12572/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12572\">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a> was in development at the same time but was not released until years later. Some of its puzzle ideas were likely incorporated into Mario 64.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p style=\"\">The soundtrack to Super Mario 64 was composed by renowned Nintendo composer <a href=\"/koji-kondo/3040-606/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-606\">Koji Kondo</a>. It was first published by <a href=\"/pony-canyon-inc/3010-926/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-926\">Pony Canyon</a> in Japan on July 19, 1996. It was later published in North America by Nintendo on November 1st, 1996.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70944/1224193-sm64ost.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1224193\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70944/1224193-sm64ost.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1224193\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/7/70944/1224193-sm64ost.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Super Mario 64 Original Soundtrack</figcaption></figure><ol><li>It's a me, Mario!</li><li>Title Theme</li><li>Peach's Message</li><li>Opening</li><li>Super Mario 64 Main Theme</li><li>Slider</li><li>Inside the Castle Walls</li><li>Looping Steps</li><li>Dire, Dire Docks</li><li>Lethal Lava Land</li><li>Snow Mountain</li><li>Haunted House</li><li>Merry-Go-Round</li><li>Cave Dungeon</li><li>Pirahna Plant's Lullaby</li><li>Powerful Mario</li><li>Metallic Mario</li><li>File Select</li><li>Correct Solution</li><li>Toad's Message</li><li>Power Star</li><li>Race Fanfare</li><li>Star Catch Fanfare</li><li>Game Start</li><li>Course Clear</li><li>Game Over</li><li>Stage Boss</li><li>Koopa's Message</li><li>Koopa's Road</li><li>Koopa's Theme</li><li>Koopa Clear</li><li>Ultimate Koopa</li><li>Ultimate Koopa Clear</li><li>Ending Demo</li><li>Staff Roll</li><li>Pirahna Plant's Lullaby-Piano</li></ol><h2>Reception</h2><p style=\"\">Super Mario 64 is one of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful video games of all time.

Mario Party 5 was released on November 10, 2003 in North America, on November 28, 2003 in Japan, and on December 5, 2003 in PAL regions. The game was developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-419\" href=\"/hudson-entertainment-inc/3010-419/\" slug=\"hudson-entertainment-inc\"> Hudson Soft</a> and published by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" slug=\"nintendo\"> Nintendo</a> for the Nintendo GameCube. <br/><br/>Mario Party 5 was generally well-received by critics. Reviewers found that the new minigames were fun and interesting, but due to the few original aspects of the game, it was criticized. However, Mario Party 5 still became a Player's Choice title in 2004. Mario Party 5 has an average rating of 71% on Game Rankings and of 69% on Metacritic.<br/><br/><h2>Story</h2>Mario Party 5 is set in the world of Dream Depot, a world that contains seven different game boards. The single-player story modes involves the player in a variety of games against the  Koopa Kids, who have been dispatched as part of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-337\" href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\" slug=\"bowser\"> Bowser</a>'s plot to take over Dream Depot.<br/><br/><h2>Gameplay<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6393/410823-5_mario_party.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-410823\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6393/410823-5_mario_party.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-410823\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6393/410823-5_mario_party.jpg\"></a><figcaption>A four player minigame.</figcaption></figure></h2>Mario Party 5 retains the traditional Mario Party gameplay. Each \"level\" is a game board, with the objective to gain the most stars by the end of the game. Stars are usually available for purchase for 20 coins (if the player doesn't have enough coins, they just pass by and must wait until the next time they pass the designated space). Coins are earned by landing on certain squares or winning minigames.<br/><br/>Minigames all have varying goals, with several different types of minigames. There are four player minigames, that have all of the players playing against each other. One versus three minigames have one player (usually with a large advantage) against three others. Two versus two has two teams of two against each other. Battle minigames having varying goals. A <a data-ref-id=\"3005-299\" href=\"/donkey-kong/3005-299/D\" slug=\"donkey-kong\"> Donkey Kong</a> minigame has goals relating to collecting coins. A duel minigame is a minigame between two randomly selected players.  Bowser minigames are minigames that Bowser presents near the end of the single-player game. In all there are 75 in the game (a 50% increase from Mario Party 4's minigame count, which was 50).<br/><br/>Mario Party 5's multiplayer mode is called Party Mode. Up to four players can compete on any of the game boards. Before playing a game, the players can select difficulty of computer controlled opponents, as well as the amount of turns in the game, ranging from 10-50. There are ten playable characters in the game (<a data-ref-id=\"3005-177\" href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" slug=\"mario\"> Mario</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-370\" href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" slug=\"luigi\"> Luigi</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-709\" href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709/\" slug=\"princess-peach\"> Peach</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-700\" href=\"/yoshi/3005-700/\" slug=\"yoshi\"> Yoshi</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-24\" href=\"/wario/3005-24/\" slug=\"wario\"> Wario</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-807\" href=\"/princess-daisy/3005-807/\" slug=\"princess-daisy\"> Daisy</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-785\" href=\"/waluigi/3005-785/\" slug=\"waluigi\"> Waluigi</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-845\" href=\"/toad/3005-845/\" slug=\"toad\"> Toad</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-943\" href=\"/boo/3005-943/\" slug=\"boo\"> Boo</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10401\" href=\"/koopa-kid/3005-10401/\" slug=\"koopa-kid\">Koopa Kid</a>).

Previous games had shops where players could purchase items. In Mario Party 5, capsules can be gathered by passing a Capsule Machine. Capsules contain certain items, from injuring opponents in one's path, to extending the number of spaces moved in one turn. You can use it on yourself for coins, or throw your capsule up to 10 spaces away from you.<br/><br/>Mario Party 5 also introduced a \"Super-Duel Mode,\" which has players in a vehicle, combating in a variety of events.

To complete the game, Mario must defeat every single boss to collect a Star Key, which he can then use to proceed through the final board to a battle with Bowser.<br/><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12541/391517-super_mario_ball_16.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-391517\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12541/391517-super_mario_ball_16.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-391517\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12541/391517-super_mario_ball_16.png\"></a><figcaption>I don't know if I trust these dudes.....</figcaption></figure>Mario, Peach, and some Toads are at the Fun Fair screwing around with a cannon-like machine that turns people into pinballs. Some Goombas sneak up while Peach is in the machine and fire her into Bowser's Castle. It's up to Mario to once again save Peach, this time in the form of a pinball!<br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><br/>There are five different boards for Mario to travel through:<br/><br/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><b>Funfair</b> - Where it all goes wrong. Bounce around circus attractions and confront Big Boo in the haunted house.</li><li><b>Snowy</b> - The game's ice stage.

To collect stars on a board, Mario can complete different tasks. These tasks generally involve destroying all of the enemies on a screen, although the behavior of these enemies tends to vary. Once you've collected enough stars, you can pass through the star doors to gain access to the boss fight. Defeating a boss will earn Mario a star key, all four are required for him to unlock the doors in Firey and reach Bowser.<br/><br/>Each stage also features a red switch. Hitting it will release eight red coins onto the stage, which Mario can then collect for another star. Once he does this the switch will be replaced by a red question mark block. Hitting the block will give Mario a red Yoshi Egg.<br/><br/><h3>Items</h3><br/>Items can be used to help Mario on his journey. They are either found in question mark blocks or bought from Toad. They do many different things, like doubling the size of your pinball or making it harder to let it pass through your flippers. The different items are:<br/><br/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><b>Mega Mushroom:</b> Doubles the size of the pinball.<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12541/391318-super_mario_ball_47.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-391318\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12541/391318-super_mario_ball_47.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-391318\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12541/391318-super_mario_ball_47.png\"></a><figcaption>Bees!</figcaption></figure> </li><li><b>Mini-Mushroom:</b> Shrinks the pinball.

It is the first installment for the Nintendo GameCube, as well. The game was released on October 21, 2002 in North America, on November 8, 2002 in Japan, and on November 29, 2002 in PAL regions. Mario Party 4 was developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-419\" href=\"/hudson-entertainment-inc/3010-419/\" slug=\"hudson-entertainment-inc\"> Hudson Soft</a> and published by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" slug=\"nintendo\"> Nintendo</a>. The game is largely similar to previous installments in the franchise, leading to complaints from critics and fans for lack of originality. Despite this, the game was praised for its simplistic-but-fun minigames, graphical improvement, and whimsical music. Mario Party 4 holds a 74% average rating on Game Rankings and a 70% average rating on Metacritic.<br/><br/>The plot of the game involves several characters from the game finding a \"Party Cube,\" which can be used to create a party and game boards revolving around their dreams. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-337\" href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\" slug=\"bowser\"> Bowser</a>, naturally, decides to be the rotten apple by spoiling everything with his own game board.<br/><br/><h2>Gameplay<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6393/384445-marioparty4_001_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-384445\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6393/384445-marioparty4_001_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-384445\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6393/384445-marioparty4_001_large.jpg\"></a><figcaption>An example of a minigame.</figcaption></figure></h2>Mario Party 4 uses the same traditional gameplay as the three previous games in the franchise. The game takes place on a variety of boards, on which an individual \"board game\" takes place. Characters from the Mario franchise traverse these boards, with goals depending on what board and mode it is. In the single-player story mode, one player plays against several computer-controlled opponents, while in the multiplayer mode, several players play against one another. Squares on the board do different effects, such as triggering a minigame, giving coins, opening a shop, or triggering the opportunity to gain a star (the goal of the game). There are only a few other items in the game, mostly available for purchase, but Mini and Mega Mushrooms can be gained by stepping on the right square.<br/><br/>There are several different types of minigames in Mario Party 4. Each minigame awards coins for the player, which can be saved and then used to purchase a star. The types of minigames are four player minigames, one versus three minigames, two versus two minigames, battle minigames, Bowser minigames, story minigames, and Extra Room minigames. Four player, one versus three, and two versus two are all played with the corresponding amount of players. Battle minigames are where the players all contribute to an award \"pot,\" of which the winner gets a large percentage. Bowser minigames are encountered towards the end of the game, while story minigames are only available during the single-player mode. Extra Room minigames can be accessed in the Extra Room.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70944/1233659-bowser_s_gnarly_party.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1233659\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70944/1233659-bowser_s_gnarly_party.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1233659\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/70944/1233659-bowser_s_gnarly_party.jpg\"></a><figcaption>One of the 6 gameboards in Mario Party 4, Bowser's Gnarly Party. </figcaption></figure>There are six boards and eight playable characters in the game.

The six boards are Toad's Midway Madness, Koopa's Seaside Soiree, Goomba's Greedy Gala, Boo's Haunted Bash, Shy Guy's Jungle Jam, and Bowser's Gnarly Party. Each of these boards has a specific theme, with features reflecting on the setting of the board (such as a roulette in the casino board). Various locales of interest on the board include Events (which are scattered about the board), Lottery Shops (essentially gambling coins ), and Boo Houses (the Boo can be paid to steal from other players). Most other spaces are either red or blue (which subtract or add coins).<br/><br/><h2>Minigames</h2><h3>Four player minigames</h3><br/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li> Avalanche!</li><li>Bob-omb Breakers</li><li>Booksquirm</li><li>Domination</li><li>Long Claw of the Law</li><li>Manta Rings</li><li> Mario Medley</li><li>Mario Speedwagons</li><li>Mr. Blizzard's Brigade</li><li>Paratrooper Plunge</li><li>Photo Finish</li><li>Slime Time</li><li>Stamp Out!</li><li>Take a Breather</li><li>Three Throw</li><li>Toad's Quick Draw </li></ul><br/><h3>One versus three minigames</h3><br/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Blame it on the Crane</li><li>Candlelight Flight</li><li>Fish n' Drips</li><li>GOOOOOOOAL!!</li><li> Hide and Go BOOM!</li><li>Hop or Pop</li><li>Makin' Waves</li><li>Money Belts</li><li>Tree Stomp </li></ul><br/><h3>Two versus two minigames</h3><br/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Cheep Cheep Sweep</li><li>Cliffhangers</li><li>Dungeon Duos</li><li>Order Up</li><li>Pair-a-Sailing</li><li>Reverse-a-Bomb</li><li>Right Oar Left?</li><li>Team Treasure Trek</li><li>The Great Deflate </li></ul><br/><h3>Battle minigames</h3><br/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li> Bowser's Bigger Blast</li><li>Butterfly Blitz</li><li>Chain Chomp Fever</li><li>Paths of Peril</li><li>Rumble Fishing</li><li>Trace Race </li></ul><br/><h3>Other mini-games</h3><br/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Mega Board Mayhem</li><li>Mini Board Mad-Dash </li><li>Panels Of Doom</li><li>Bowser Wrestling</li><li>The Final Battle! </li><li>Archaeologuess</li><li> Bowser Bop</li><li>Goomba's Chip Flip</li><li>Kareening Koopas</li><li>Mystic Match 'Em </li><li>Booksquirm</li><li>Panel Panic</li><li>Barrel Baron</li><li>Bob-omb X-ing</li><li>Doors of Doom</li><li>Goomba Stomp</li><li>Jigsaw Jitters</li><li>Mushroom Medic</li><li>Beach Volley Folley </li><li> Balloon of Doom</li><li>Darts of Doom</li><li>Fruits of Doom </li></ul>",

This version was developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-3154\" href=\"/nintendo-rd2/3010-3154/\" slug=\"nintendo-rd2\">Nintendo R&amp;D2.</a> It included several graphic and sound enhancements in the form of enlarged sprites, multiple hit combos, and digital voice acting. For the first time ever on <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" slug=\"nintendo\">Nintendo's</a> part was a system devised to score this game. Two notable additions are the new character, Robirdo, a robotic Birdo who acts as the boss of the third world, and the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-700\" href=\"/yoshi/3005-700/\" slug=\"yoshi\">Yoshi</a> Challenge, which encourages players to revisit stages and search for Yoshi eggs. Nintendo's decision to choose it as the Game Boy Advance launch game was seen by some as misguided; GameSpot in particular thought that Super Mario Bros. 3 or Super Mario World would have been a far better choice for a launch title considering their popularity. (Both of those titles would eventually be remade as part of the Advance series.) However, IGN praised the choice, calling it \"one of the most polished and creative platformers of the era.\" Nonetheless, it was a best-selling launch game, showing that the game still appealed to Nintendo fans. Recently, the game has become part of the Player's Choice lineup for Game Boy Advance as one of the system's first three Player's Choice games (along with Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-11016\" href=\"/yoshis-island-super-mario-advance-3/3030-11016/\" slug=\"yoshis-island-super-mario-advance-3\">Super Mario Advance 3</a> ).</p><p style=\"\">Before starting a level you can choose between <a data-ref-id=\"3005-177\" href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" slug=\"mario\">Mario</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-370\" href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" slug=\"luigi\">Luigi</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-845\" href=\"/toad/3005-845/\" slug=\"toad\">Toad</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-709\" href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709/\" slug=\"princess-peach\">Peach</a>. Each of the characters have different strengths and weaknesses such as Luigi who can jump high though not very far and Toad is faster. As well as strength which determines how quickly the character can pull up a item in the ground.</p>",

The visual style of the game is borrowed it's SNES contemporary Super Mario World, from the title's font, to the overworld city maps.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/215417-1109440421_01.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-215417\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/215417-1109440421_01.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-215417\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/775/215417-1109440421_01.png\"></a><figcaption>Even the greats have bad days.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Mario sets off towards Bowser's castle to stop Bowser's evil plan of covering the world in water by melting Antarctica. It is later discovered that Bowser plans to melt the continent with a large number of hair dryers, purchased with money gained from stolen valuable artifacts from across the Earth.</p><p style=\"\">While Luigi is hesitant to enter Bowser's castle, Mario makes a bold entrance, only to be captured moments later. Luigi must then enter the castle solo, searching through each of the dungeon's warp doors for Mario, while at the same time recovering all of the stolen artifacts from Bowser's loyal Koopas. Upon returning each stolen artifact, more doors to the castle unlock, allowing Luigi to search more places until he eventually reaches Antarctica to save his brother and stop Bowser from his evil plan.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">From the warp doors in Bowser's castle, players are transported to various cities across the world. Here, by the flyers attached to tourist information booths, Luigi discovers that the Koopas have stolen culturally significant artifacts. Luigi is able to speak to other people populating the town, ranging from a professor, to a schoolboy, to a police woman. The player gathers clues to correctly identify the missing artifacts, such as the Sistine Chapel painting, or the Forbidden City. To gather addtional clues, Luigi also has access to a computer and telephone, both from which he can learn about the missing artifacts. Luigi can call general information, and also receives calls from Mario from time to time, giving tips on generic gameplay.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/215418-1109561316_00.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-215418\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/215418-1109561316_00.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-215418\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/775/215418-1109561316_00.png\"></a><figcaption>Save the world, or keep the flute.

Being in the real world, Luigi is also able to speed up travel by taking a taxi cab across town, or out to hard to reach places, such as Alcatraz Island.</p><p style=\"\">A map showing the entire world, called the Globulator, allows players to control Yoshi, as he hops from continent to continent. When the player places Yoshi on the correct city of Luigi's location, Yoshi appears on the stage with him, and Luigi is able to ride the dinosaur throughout the city. Players will not be able to stomp on Koopas until they have acquired Yoshi.</p><p style=\"\">Once the player has stomped a Koopa to reclaim an artifact, Luigi must take it back to the proper information booth. There, the player will be asked a series of questions by an information attendant, bearing resemblance to Princess Peach. If the player fails a certain number of questions, she will dismiss Luigi as a phony, and he will have to wait until the information booth is reopened to attempt to return the artifact again.</p><p style=\"\">Upon the successful returning and delivery, Luigi takes a picture of the fully restored artifact for his photo album. Players are able to view this photo album at any point in the game, along with the facts learned along the way about the important cultural piece.</p>",

The player (or players in multiplayer) are placed on one of many \"boards\" (essentially stages or levels). These boards are separated by spaces (like a regular game board). The goal of the game is to collect the most stars. Only one star is on the board at one time, and it can be purchased for the price of 20 coins. The one other way to get stars is to steal them by using a <a href=\"/boo/3005-943/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-943\">Boo</a>, who will steal another player's star for the price of 50 coins.</p><p style=\"\">Coins can be collected by landing on blue spaces on the game board or by winning minigames. Coins can then be used to purchase items and stars. In addition, if the game is a tie, then the player with the most coins will win. Coins can be lost as well; if the player lands on a red space, a <a href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-337\">Bowser</a> space, or loses a certain minigame (not all minigames cause the loser to lose coins).</p><p style=\"\">At the end of a game, three bonus stars are granted to the players. One star goes to the person who had the most coins during the game (not total, at one point), one goes to the person who got the most coins during minigames, and one star goes to the person who landed on the most question mark spaces. If there is a tie for these awards, then the player who has the most coins will be awarded the star.</p><p style=\"\">Minigames are what Mario Party was most praised for. Mario Party has 56 minigames in all of four different types. These types are four player minigames (a free-for-all minigame), two versus two (where two players are on a team versus another team), one versus three (where one player with a large advantage competes against the other three), or one player minigames (they only occur when the player lands on a one-player minigame space, and give the player the opportunity to either gain or lose coins.</p><p style=\"\">A couple of the games minigames involve turning the analong stick in a circular motion as fast as possible. Players quickly relaized that the best strategy to winning was to place their palm flat on the analog stick and spin. This had an unfortunate side effect of the analog sick cutting into the players skin causing noticeable blisters. Nintendo, fearing a lawsuit, eventually offered free latex gloves to anyone who was hurt in this way. Subsequently, follow up games in the series replace this action with alternating between two face buttons rapidly.</p><h3><b>Boards (Stages)</b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/971531-skyparty.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-971531\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/971531-skyparty.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-971531\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/971531-skyparty.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\"><b>Artwork of Mario's Rainbow Castle.</b></p><ul><li><b>Mario's Rainbow Castle</b>: A linear board where the path ends at the main tower, there the player will meet either Toad or Bowser.

At the beginning you choose a your character and ally character.

The stages is actually the mini-games from the game and you need to win them or beat their condition to pass them and be allowed to move on. The coins you earn from mini-games goes into a total and earn you a extra life each time it passes 100. Fail the mini-game and you lose a life, lose all of them and you start from where you last saved. On the map there is also some Koopa Troopa spaces where you can save and return to the village. The map path is linar but does a split and reconnects later at some point, allowing the player to chose what mini-games he wants to challenge.</p><h2>Mini Games</h2><p style=\"\">4-Player Mini Games</p><ul><li>Balloon Burst: Hit A and B (or A and Z) back and forth repeatedly in order to make a Bowser balloon inflate and, eventually, explode.

However, the gameplay is a major departure from said formula in one aspect: the introduction of Mario’s hydro-pumping backpack, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3534\" href=\"/fludd/3005-3534/\" slug=\"fludd\">  F.L.U.D.D.</a> <br/><br/>Mario utilizes F.L.U.D.D. throughout a majority of the game, and can apply it to a wide variety of different uses – most notably, the ability to Squirt objects and enemies that are due for a good rinse, as well as the ability to hover, which allows for a safe recovery from dangerous falls, and provides the aptitude to reach previously inaccessible areas.<br/><br/> <h2>Gameplay</h2> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/340179-sms_mario.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-340179\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/340179-sms_mario.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-340179\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2714/340179-sms_mario.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Mario with the water-blasting backpack, F.L.U.D.D.</figcaption></figure>Super Mario Sunshine has gameplay similar to previous Super Mario game, Super Mario 64. As with every <a data-ref-id=\"3005-177\" href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" slug=\"mario\">  Mario</a> game, however, it adds new gameplay aspects and features. Likely the most important upgrade is the addition of F.L.U.D.D. (Flash Liquidizing Ultra Dousing Device). F.L.U.D.D. is a pack that Mario wears that can either spray water or use water power to have Mario hover. Other nozzles can be unlocked later: the Rocket Nozzle and the Turbo Nozzle. The Rocket Nozzle can shoot Mario several hundred feet into the air. The Turbo Nozzle can allow Mario to run at incredible speeds, even allowing him to run on water and break through thing s like doors.<br/><br/>Mario can also enlist the aid of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-700\" href=\"/yoshi/3005-700/\" slug=\"yoshi\">  Yoshi</a>. When riding Yoshi, he can eat enemies, fruit, and even birds. Some of the birds grant a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1984\" href=\"/shine-sprite/3055-1984/\" slug=\"shine-sprite\">Shine Sprite</a> upon being eaten, while others give coins. After eating fruit, Yoshi can spit juice from the fruit. This juice can dissolve large orange blocks, which are obstacles blocking certain secret areas. The juice can also turn enemies into platforms. Based on the type of fruit, the color and effect of the juice are different. Yoshi can die in two ways that Mario can't: without eating fruit, Yoshi will die, and when Yoshi touches the water, he dies.<br/> <br/> The primary goal of Super Mario Sunshine is to collect Shine Sprites. These are in a variety of smaller levels, from the hub world of Delfino Plaza. Each Shine Sprite can be acquired by doing a specific task in the level. Every level has eight such tasks to be completed. After collecting a large enough amount of Shine Sprites, a new level is unlocked, Mario gets a new ability, or an event related to the plot. Shine Sprites can be collected in other ways, such as gathering enough blue coins (scattered around <a data-ref-id=\"3035-494\" href=\"/isle-delfino/3035-494/\" slug=\"isle-delfino\">  Isle Delfino</a>) or eating certain birds. Not all Shine Sprites need to be acquired in order to gain access to the final level; only Shadow Mario related events.<br/><br/> <h2>Plot</h2> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13933/494416-super_mario_sunshine_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-494416\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13933/494416-super_mario_sunshine_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-494416\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13933/494416-super_mario_sunshine_3.jpg\"></a></figure>The game opens with Mario, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-709\" href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709/\" slug=\"princess-peach\">  Princess Peach</a>, and several of the Princess' <a data-ref-id=\"3005-845\" href=\"/toad/3005-845/\" slug=\"toad\">  royal entourage</a> aboard a private plane, en route to <a data-ref-id=\"3035-494\" href=\"/isle-delfino/3035-494/\" slug=\"isle-delfino\">  Isle Delfino</a>, a destination that everyone believes will be a tranquil escape from the every day grind of kidnappings, fire-breathing behemoths, and general mayhem that makes the Mushroom Kingdom such an unproductive working environment.  However, the holiday is brought to an abrupt halt as soon as the vacationing group touches down on the runway, when they discover a prominent work of graffiti that bears an apparent resemblance to the mustachioed plumber. Mario travels to the other end of the runway to seek help in clearing the obstruction, and is introduced to a talking, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-754\" href=\"/water-gun/3055-754/\" slug=\"water-gun\">  water-pumping</a> backpack, nicknamed F.L.U.D.D. <br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5758/355114-supmarsun4.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-355114\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5758/355114-supmarsun4.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-355114\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5758/355114-supmarsun4.png\"></a><figcaption>Mario collecting a Shine Sprite.</figcaption></figure>With the help of his newfound semi-sidekick, Mario is able to clean up the runway of all graffiti and restore it to its original state. However, no sooner is this act of goodwill completed than two of Isle Delfino's finest arrive on the scene to bring Mario under arrest for evidently fouling up several other areas of the island. After a fairly unfair trial, Mario is ultimately sentenced to clean the <i>entire</i> island of all of the pollution that blemishes it before he will be permitted to leave. Doing so will quite literally brighten up the place, as a good many of the island's \" Shine Sprites\" have gone missing due to the rampant vandalism.  These \"Shine Sprites\" traditionally gather at the \"Shine Gate\" in the center of town, and are the source of the pleasant rays that illuminate the island paradise; but, the malicious work of the real vandal has essentially scared them all away, leaving the island covered, in large part, by a persistent shadow.<br/><br/>By traversing the many areas of Isle Delfino, and working to undo the true culprit's defacement and overall trouble-making, Mario will collect and return the \"Shine Sprites\" to their rightful place and restore the island to its normal, immaculate state.",

After getting a row of blocks lined up (with no holes in it), then that row is deleted and the player is granted an amount of points. As the blocks are falling, they can be rotated. The longer the game is played, the faster the blocks fall.<br/><br/><h3>Dr. Mario</h3><br/>Dr. Mario is also a puzzle game in which blocks (or rather, pill capsules) fall onto a playing field filled with germs. By matching the colored pills with with the corresponding colored germs, then the germs are slowly eliminated. After all of a single color germs are erased from the game field, then that germ dies. The game essentially lasts forever, but after level 20, the game repeats that level over and over. Each level adds more germs as compared to the last.",

Mario Party 7 takes place across a variety of boards. Each of these games has the goal of collecting the most stars, but each board has a different way of getting these stars. The multiplayer game now can have up to eight people at once. Players have are split into four teams of two, and each team must share one controller. The first player uses the control stick and L button, while the second player uses the C-stick and R button.<br/><br/>The single-player game is very different from previous Mario Party games. The player plays against either computer or human controlled opponents while attempting to complete several objectives. These objectives vary, such as collecting an amount of stars, or collecting coins.<br/><br/>The game has all of the playable characters of Mario Party 6 (save for Koopa Kid), as well as two new characters. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-177\" href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" slug=\"mario\">  Mario</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-370\" href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" slug=\"luigi\">  Luigi</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-709\" href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709/\" slug=\"princess-peach\">  Princess Peach</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-807\" href=\"/princess-daisy/3005-807/\" slug=\"princess-daisy\">  Princess Daisy</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-700\" href=\"/yoshi/3005-700/\" slug=\"yoshi\">  Yoshi</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-957\" href=\"/birdo/3005-957/\" slug=\"birdo\">  Birdo</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-845\" href=\"/toad/3005-845/\" slug=\"toad\">  Toad</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1296\" href=\"/toadette/3005-1296/\" slug=\"toadette\">  Toadette</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-24\" href=\"/wario/3005-24/\" slug=\"wario\">  Wario</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-785\" href=\"/waluigi/3005-785/\" slug=\"waluigi\">  Waluigi</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-943\" href=\"/boo/3005-943/\" slug=\"boo\">  Boo</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2410\" href=\"/dry-bones/3005-2410/\" slug=\"dry-bones\">  Dry Bones</a> are the playable characters.

However, the game did not have great reception among critics, with complaints ranging from poor graphics, tedious gameplay, and lack of online play and a widescreen mode. Mario Party 8 currently holds a 63% average on Game Rankings and a 62% average on Metacritic.<br/><br/>Mario Party 8's original release date in Europe was June 22, 2007, but Nintendo delayed the game until July 13, 2007. However, upon its release, complications arose when one of the characters in the game used the word \"spastic,\" which is very offensive for people with disabilities. Nintendo immediately recalled the game and replaced it with the word \"erratic,\" and then officially released the game on August 3, 2007.<br/><br/>The plot of the game involves a ringmaster named <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10338\" href=\"/mc-ballyhoo-and-big-top/3005-10338/\" slug=\"mc-ballyhoo-and-big-top\">  MC Ballyhoo</a> inviting <a data-ref-id=\"3005-177\" href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" slug=\"mario\">  Mario</a> and his friends to the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2115\" href=\"/star-carnival/3035-2115/\" slug=\"star-carnival\">  Star Carnival</a>, where the rest of the game takes place.<br/><br/><h2>Gameplay<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8207/277533-935598_20070223_screen016.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-277533\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8207/277533-935598_20070223_screen016.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-277533\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8207/277533-935598_20070223_screen016.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Participating in a minigame</figcaption></figure></h2>The gameplay of Mario Party 8 is largely similar to previous installments in the franchise, with obvious differences taking advantage of the Wii's unique capabilities. In the single player mode, one player competes against three computer controlled opponents across the several boards offered. The goal of the game is to collect as many stars as possible, through a variety of ways (buying them, winning them, stealing them, etc). In the case of a tie, the person with the most coins will win.<br/><br/>Multiplayer mode is what Mario Party is really known for, however. In multiplayer, up to four players can compete on one of the several boards offered (less than four people means that there have to be computer controlled opponents in addition to the human players). There are other modes as well. Party Tent is where the players can have a variety of different battles with various amounts of players. Star Battle Arena is essentially the single player story. Minigame Tent allows players to merely play the minigames offered, instead of going to a particular board. In the Extras Zone, players can access minigames not shown in the other modes. Fun Bazaar is where the player can purchase new minigames and other extras.<br/><br/>All of the playable characters from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7508\" href=\"/mario-party-7/3030-7508/\" slug=\"mario-party-7\">  Mario Party 7</a> return in Mario Party 8.

Naturally, many take advantage of the Wii Remote's motion capabilities. This is taken advantage of in a variety of ways, from rowing a boat to a shooting gallery. There are minigames that also use the buttons, but the main usage usually involves some sort of motion.<br/><br/>One new feature introduced in Mario Party 8 is the ability to transform using candy power ups. These can be obtained from a Candy Shop, or the candy spaces on the board (which only appear on some boards). Candy effects range from allowing the player to roll the dice more than once, to allowing characters to \"attack\" other characters as they are moving on the board. <br/><br/><h2>Game Boards</h2>  Six game boards are available in Mario Party 8.  Their configuration varies slightly depending on the game mode being played and each board has a different 'gimmick' or mechanism to win. <ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><b>DK's Treetop Temple:</b> Standard Mario Party gameplay, get to the stars on the game board before your opponents do.</li></ul> <ul class=\"plain-list\"><li> <b>Goomba's Booty Boardwalk</b>: Reach the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2891\" href=\"/goomba/3015-2891/\" slug=\"goomba\">  Goomba</a> at the end of the boardwalk with 50 coins before your opponents do in the Star Battle Arena mode to earn a star but in the Party Tent, you can get it for free just by reaching him.</li></ul> <ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><b>King Boo's Haunted Hideaway:</b> This board consists of a random map that gets slowly revealed as you explore.

Instead of beginning your adventure as Mario, <a href=\"/yoshi/3005-700/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-700\">Yoshi</a> is the first character you are able to play, who has woken up from his deep slumber. There is also a small event before you enter the castle in which you have to capture a rabbit with a key to the front door. Yoshi sets off into the castle in search of his friends, and you will soon be able to play as all four characters.

Nintendo came up with a solution of using the touch screen as an analog stick. The controls can be changed to suit both right and left-handed play styles. During gameplay, pressing select will immediately bring up the \"Control Modes\" screen which provide the three following options.</p><h4>Standard Mode</h4><p style=\"\">This mode uses the D-pad for movement. Holding Y will cause the character to dash. You can also perform a charge dash by holding Y, then pressing a direction on the D-pad will cause the player character to move immediately in the desired direction.</p><h4>Touch Mode</h4><p style=\"\">The original Nintendo DS models came with a wrist strap with a thumb piece used to simulate analog control on the touch screen. A circle will appear on the touch screen indicating the speed the player character will move in. The circle will move if you try to slide off of the circle's radius. Letting go allows you to set a new neutral point on the touch screen controls.</p><h4>Dual-Hand Mode</h4><p style=\"\">This mode allows for the use of a stylus for analog control. A bigger circle will appear on the touch screen which indicates the player's speed. It functions similarly to how the circle behaves in Touch Mode, however you can also use the D-pad for functions similar to the face buttons. This is suited for those who use the NIntendo DS on a flat system.</p><p style=\"\">Throughout the castle grounds you'll often notice small bunnies hopping around wildly. Though they may seem just for decoration, they're actually a small challenge for you. Each rabbit you catch unlocks a new mini-game in Princess Peach's Rec Room. Each of the four characters has seven rabbits to catch—below is a list of their locations. The easiest way to catch the rabbits is to chase them into a corner and dive at them. They always run in a pattern, giving you a chance to predict where they go next.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h3>Yoshi</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14097/791469-920758_20041007_screen009.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-791469\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14097/791469-920758_20041007_screen009.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-791469\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14097/791469-920758_20041007_screen009.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Yoshi in Dry Dry Desert.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">You begin the game as <a href=\"/yoshi/3005-700/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-700\"> Yoshi</a>, and until you collect eight stars total he's the only character you can play as. Yoshi has a few unique abilities, including his \"floaty\" jump. If you jump and hold down the jump button in mid-air, Yoshi's legs will flutter underneath him, letting him float a little further than normal. Also, Yoshi can fire eggs as projectiles. To lay an egg you'll have to first grab an enemy with Yoshi's tongue and then press the crouch button. These eggs will ricochet off of multiple enemies if you line 'em up right, too!</p><p style=\"\">The unique ability that lets Yoshi solve puzzles others can't is his ability to breathe fire. Break open a red \"?\" block and grab the power flower to Yoshi fire breath for a short period of time. His fire breath can be used to melt ice blocks, or to damage enemies.</p><p style=\"\">He's also the only character that does not fight with his fists, therefore he is unable to fight ghosts, which also means you cannot enter Big Boo's Haunt as Yoshi.</p><p style=\"\"><b>How to Unlock: </b></p><p style=\"\">You don't need to unlock Yoshi—he's available at the very start of the game!</p><h3>Mario</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1851/203846-dm64_comparison.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-203846\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1851/203846-dm64_comparison.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-203846\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1851/203846-dm64_comparison.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Graphical comparison between SM64DS (left), and SM64 (right)</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\"> Mario</a></p><p style=\"\">is probably the most versatile character in the game, though Luigi runs a close second. Mario is very maneuverable and quick, and his most unique ability is his wall kick. Only Mario can jump off of walls to gain extra height, which will let you reach certain areas that other characters can't (or just take shortcuts that are beyond the reach of others).</p><p style=\"\">When Mario grabs a power flower he'll inflate and float around. You can change Mario's altitude by rapidly tapping the jump button, letting Mario reach vertical platforms that are out of reach to others. Also, some red \"?\" boxes will give Mario a feather instead of a power flower. With this feather, Mario can glide through the air to reach new areas. You can start flying either by shooting out of a cannon or by performing a triple jump.</p><p style=\"\"><strong>How to Unlock:</strong></p><p style=\"\">You first need eight power stars before you can unlock Mario. When you've got the first eight, go to the</p><p style=\"\"><em>Goomboss Battle</em></p><p style=\"\">behind Princess Peach's room and defeat the Goomboss.</p><h3>Luigi</h3><p style=\"\"><a href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\"> Luigi</a>'s greatest strength is in his jumps. Like Yoshi, Luigi can sort of hover in mid-air for a second by holding the jump button. More importantly, Luigi has a very unique back flip technique. Luigi's back flip goes higher than anyone else's, and as Luigi falls from his back flip he slowly twirls down to the ground. You can use this back flip to reach high places, <em>or</em> to glide across large gaps that other characters can't jump across. To perform a back flip, just jump while crouching.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/31/10599-luigi_mp.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-10599\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/31/10599-luigi_mp.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-10599\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/31/10599-luigi_mp.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Luigi </figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Have Luigi grab a power flower and he'll turn invisible. While invisible, Luigi has the special ability to pass through certain objects, including certain paintings, mirrors, and especially cages. Since the invisibility only lasts a short time, you'll have to be quick to get to your goal once you grab the power flower with Luigi.</p><p style=\"\"><strong>How to Unlock:</strong></p><p style=\"\">Once you've collected the first eight power stars you can then access the</p><p style=\"\"><em>Big Boo's Haunt</em></p><p style=\"\">course in the basement.

He's slower than everyone else, has shorter jumps, and is generally less wieldy. However, what he lacks in maneuverability he more than makes up for in raw power. Wario's strength is unique, and he's the only character in the game that is capable of busting open the black-brick blocks that are located in some of the courses.</p><p style=\"\">Wario's special power flower ability will turn him into a giant hunk of metal. When Wario is in metal form he's nearly immovable—strong winds won't be able to push him from cliffs, and even powerful water currents can't budge him. You can use this unique ability to get Wario into places that other characters just can't reach.</p><p style=\"\"><strong>How to Unlock:</strong> You won't be able to unlock Wario until after you've collected thirty power stars. When you unlock the second floor of the castle, head up there with Luigi. Grab the power flower in a nearby room and jump through the mirror to hop into the painting of Wario and complete the <em>Chief Chilly Challenge</em>.</p><h2>Recreational Room (Mini Games)</h2><p style=\"\">In addition to the main game, Super Mario 64 DS also has a mini-game mode that utilizes much of the touch screen controls. Divided into four sections representing the four characters, each section hosts a different variety of mini-games. Yoshi's mini-games include Wanted, a game where you have to find a character in a sea of impostors, and a Luigi's Mansion mini-game with the objective of using your stylus as a flashlight to detect a <a href=\"/boo/3005-943/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-943\">Boo</a>, among others. Mario's mini-games include a couple platforming-jumping games with the objective to squash the <a href=\"/shy-guy/3005-940/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-940\">Shy Guys</a> and prevent Mario from falling, a couple of puzzle mini-games where you have to draw the path of a falling Mario head to keep it away from the piranha plants, and a turtle shell-bowling game with the objective to get as many points as possible. Luigi's mini-game section includes many casino-style gambling games like roulette and memory. Wario's mini-games include a missile-command style bomb-omb game, and a snow-ball game. Several of these games and more are unlockable as you play throughout the game.Several of these minigames were included as extas in <a href=\"/new-super-mario-bros/3025-1546/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1546\">New Super Mario Bros</a> when it was released two years later/</p><h2>Versus Mode</h2><p style=\"\">The last additional feature Super Mario 64 DS has is a versus mode. In this mode, you can compete against your friends in levels such as Princess's Secret Slide, Castle Grounds, Sunshine Isles and Battle Fort. The main objective is to collect as many stars as you can.</p>",

It was also one of the last games to actually be released on the console. In fact, the game became very rare in <a data-ref-id=\"3035-289\" href=\"/europe/3035-289/\" slug=\"europe\">Europe</a> and is sold online for very high prices. Mario Party 3 probably made the biggest additions and changes in the history of the series. Because of this, it very much became a love-or-hate game to the fans of the series. Many of the new additions made in this game did not make a return when the series shifted over to the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-23\" href=\"/gamecube/3045-23/\" slug=\"gamecube\">GameCube</a> with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4660\" href=\"/mario-party-4/3030-4660/\" slug=\"mario-party-4\">Mario Party 4</a>.</p><h2>Battle Royal</h2><h3>Description</h3><p style=\"\">Battle Royal is the same mode that was used in previous Mario Party games. The objective is to move around the game board and collect as many stars as possible. The person who has the most stars by the end of the predetermined amount of turns wins. Players obtain stars at the Star Space for 20 <a data-ref-id=\"3055-219\" href=\"/coin/3055-219/\" slug=\"coin\">coins</a>. The Star Space is randomly determined and each time somebody gets a star, the Star Space moves to another location on the board. At the end of each turn, the 4 characters compete in a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-116\" href=\"/minigames/3015-116/\" slug=\"minigames\">mini-game</a>. The winner(s) of the mini-game receives 10 coins. To move around the board, players hit a 10-sided dice block, and the number they get determines how far they move.</p><h3>Spaces</h3><p style=\"\">There are a total of 8 different spaces players can land on each board:</p><ul><li><b>Blue Space</b>: The most frequent space on all of the boards. If you land on this, you will get 3 coins (6 in the last 5 turns) and a blue status for that turn.</li><li><b>Red Space</b>: Landing on this will make you lose 3 coins (6 in the last 5 turns) and give you a red status for that turn.</li><li><b>Happening Space</b>: A green space with a question mark on top. Landing on one has a variety of actions, depending on the board and the location. It will give you a green status for that turn</li><li><b>Bowser Space</b>: The worse space to possibly land on. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-337\" href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\" slug=\"bowser\">Bowser</a> will bring up a roulette, each option with a horrible consequence, which includes losing stars and coins. This also gives a red status.</li><li><b>Chance Time Space</b>: A green space with an exclamation mark on top. This brings up a slot machine with 3 panels. The left and right panel are the playing characters while the middle one is the yield. Players can give a certain amount of coins or stars to the other player, or they could both swap coins or stars. This also gives a green status.</li><li><b>Battle Space</b>: All players must give up a certain amount of coins to the pot and play a mini-game. 1st place gets 70% and second place gets 30%.</li><li><b>Item Space</b>: One of the best spaces because there is a high reward and no risk. You either play an item mini-game to earn items or you get asked a question by <a data-ref-id=\"3005-845\" href=\"/toad/3005-845/\" slug=\"toad\">Toad</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3005-825\" href=\"/bowser-jr/3005-825/\" slug=\"bowser-jr\">Baby Bowser</a> and they give you an item if you picked the right answer. This space gives a green status.</li><li><b>Koopa Bank Space</b>: Passing by this space will force you to give up 5 coins to the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2557\" href=\"/koopa-troopa/3015-2557/\" slug=\"koopa-troopa\">Koopa</a> Bank. Landing on this space will give you all of the coins the Koopa Bank has collected. Landing here gives a green status.</li><li><b>Game Guy Space</b>: Landing on this space will force you to surrender all of your coins, and play a Game Guy mini-game. Winning will double your coin total, but if you lose, all your coins will be lost.</li></ul><h3>Mini-Game Types</h3><ul><li><b>4 Player Mini-Game</b>: This mini-game will take place after the turn is over if all of the characters have a blue status* or if all have a red status*. In these mini-games all 4 players are competing against each other to win the mini-game.</li><li><b>1 VS 3 Mini-Game:</b> This mini-game will take place after the turn is over if one character has a blue status* and three have a red status* <i>or</i> if one character has a red status* and three have a blue status*. In these mini-game one person takes on a team of three.</li><li><b>2 VS 2 Mini-Game:</b> This mini-game takes place after the turn is over if two characters have a blue status* and the two other characters have a red status*. In these mini-games, a two teams of two compete against eachother for victory.</li><li><b>Battle Mini-Game:</b> A battle mini-game will occur if somebody lands on the Battle Space. Every player must give up a certain amount of coins to the pot. 1st place gets 70% and 2nd place gets 30%.</li><li><b>Item Mini-Game:</b> One person can play an item mini-game if they land on the Item Space. Obviously, they can earn items by winning.</li><li><b>Duel Mini-Game:</b> A player can use an item, The Dueling Glove, to initiate a duel. The person who initiates the duel wagers the amount of coins or stars both players put in the pot. The winner takes all of them. Duels can also be stated if two players land on the same space in the last 5 turns.</li><li><b>Game Guy Mini-Game</b>: When somebody lands on a Game Guy space, they must play a Game-Guy mini-game. He/She must wager all of their coins; winning doubles the amount of coins, but losing takes away every coin. These mini-games are completely luck based.</li></ul><p style=\"\">* - If you received a green status for that turn, a computer will randomly assign you to a blue or red status.</p><h2>Duel Mode</h2><h3>Description</h3><p style=\"\">Duel mode was a completely new addition to the Mario Party series. In duel mode there are only two combatants instead of the usual 4. The objective here is different than Battle Royal; instead of collecting stars, the mission is to remove the enemy's 5 heart pieces. To do this, you can use a partner that you pay 10 coins for, and they will move in front of you. If you walk into the enemy, they will attack him or her which will result in lost heart pieces, depending on how strong the partner is. You can also have a partner be put behind you so you can use some defense. The partner you get is determined by a roulette. Partners also have a salary that you have to pay on a turn-basis. They will disappear if you cannot pay for their services. If both combatants are still alive by the end of the predetermined amount of turns, then the character with the most heart pieces wins. If they have the same amount of heart pieces, then the character with the most coins wins. If they still somehow have the same amount of heart pieces and coins, then the winner will be determined by who rolls a higher number on 10-sided dice block.</p><h3>Spaces</h3><p style=\"\">There are some new spaces exclusively for the Duel Mode and some from Battle Royal. There are also others from Battle Royal that are not present in Duel Mode. The following are the spaces in Duel Mode:</p><ul><li><b>Normal Space</b>: A normal, blank space. When you land on one, your characters face will mark it. If you land on the same space again, you will earn 5 coins. If enemy lands on it, you will receive 5 coins from them. You can also land it your enemy's space(s).</li><li><b>Mini-Game Space</b>: When this space is landed on, a mini-game begins and the winner receives 5 coins.</li><li><b>Power-Up Space</b>: When somebody lands on a Power-Up Space, his or her characters' stats will go up, however, so will their salary.</li><li><b>Reverse Space:</b> If landed on, you are forced to roll again and move in the opposite direction.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Happening Space</b>: A green space with a question mark on top. Landing on one has a variety of actions, depending on the board and the location.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Game Guy Space</b>: Landing on this space will force you to surrender all of your coins, and play a Game Guy mini-game. Winning will double your coin total, but if you lose, all your coins will be lost.</li></ul><h2>Story Mode</h2><h3>Description</h3><p style=\"\">In story mode, the objective is to collect 7 star-stamps. In order to do this, you must win in Battle Royal and Duel Mode games. For each stamp you must first one a Battle Royal and then win a Duel Mode game. However, for the seventh stamp, you must beat a boss. After doing so, you beat the Story Mode. By beating it, the face of the character that you beat it with will be engraved into Mt. Mariomore, a play on the American monument, Mt. Rushmore. You will also unlock a hidden mini-game and unlock super hard difficulty if you beat Story Mode on hard.</p><h2>Other Notable Additions</h2><ul><li>This was the first <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6424\" href=\"/mario-party/3030-6424/\" slug=\"mario-party\">Mario Party</a> to add additional characters to the original six. The cast for Mario Party 3 is: <a data-ref-id=\"3005-177\" href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" slug=\"mario\">Mario</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-370\" href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" slug=\"luigi\">Luigi</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-709\" href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709/\" slug=\"princess-peach\">Peach</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-700\" href=\"/yoshi/3005-700/\" slug=\"yoshi\">Yoshi</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-299\" href=\"/donkey-kong/3005-299/\" slug=\"donkey-kong\">Donkey Kong</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-24\" href=\"/wario/3005-24/\" slug=\"wario\">Wario</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-785\" href=\"/waluigi/3005-785/\" slug=\"waluigi\">Waluigi</a> (new), and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-807\" href=\"/princess-daisy/3005-807/\" slug=\"princess-daisy\">Daisy</a> (new). However, Waluigi and Daisy cannot be used in Story Mode.</li><li>This was the first entry in the series to allow multiple items to be held. Mario Party 3 allows three items to be held, while <a data-ref-id=\"3030-12162\" href=\"/mario-party-2/3030-12162/\" slug=\"mario-party-2\">Mario Party 2</a> only allowed one.</li></ul>",

The game was developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-333\" href=\"/intelligent-systems-co-ltd/3010-333/\" slug=\"intelligent-systems-co-ltd\">Intelligent Systems</a> and published by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" slug=\"nintendo\">Nintendo</a> on April 9, 2007 in North America, April 19, 2007 in Japan, September 14, 2007 in Europe, and September 20, 2007 in Australia.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3005-709\" href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709/\" slug=\"princess-peach\">Princess Peach</a> has been kidnapped <i>again</i>. Assuming Bowser is to blame, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-177\" href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" slug=\"mario\">Mario</a> heads over to his castle only to discover that for once the Koopa King has <i>also</i> been kidnapped, and his army has been brainwashed by a new character, the evil <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3634\" href=\"/count-bleck/3005-3634/\" slug=\"count-bleck\">Count Bleck</a>. His plan is to brainwash and marry Bowser to Peach, an act foretold in a tome known as the Dark Prognosticus, which will bring forth a dark power known as the Chaos Heart. With this, Bleck will open an inter-dimensional rift called \"the Void\" and consume the universe. Of course, it is up to Mario to put a stop to all of this bad business.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">Super Paper Mario represents a drastic departure for the Paper Mario series in its style. The adventure game elements have been mostly done away with in favor of faster pacing and more involved action.</p><h3>Combat</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/508331-spm4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-508331\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/508331-spm4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-508331\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/508331-spm4.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Mario surrounded by enemies</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3015-192\" href=\"/turn-based/3015-192/\" slug=\"turn-based\">Turn-based</a> combat has been replaced with platforming reminiscent of the original NES Mario games, earning experience points as he progresses and defeats enemies. Depending on the enemy, Mario can jump on enemies or clobber them with any number of abilities granted by the Pixls (more on them in a minute). Enemies drop coins and hearts when defeated in addition to points which go towards his level. Defeating enemies in combos, such as jumping on several Goombas in sequence without touching the ground, will reward Mario with an additional point bonus in a manner similar to the original Mario platformers.</p><h3>Pixls</h3><p style=\"\">Instead of having partners of various origins join his crew along the trip as in the original games, Mario is accompanied in his journey by Pixls, mysterious fairies who can provide Mario with different abilities, such as running or planting bombs. New Pixls are discovered as the story progresses and can be switched at almost any time. Each has a personality that mimics their ability (Cudge is hardheaded, Fleep is whimsical, Boomer is temperamental).</p><h3>The Cast</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/212132-peachparasol.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-212132\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/212132-peachparasol.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-212132\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2714/212132-peachparasol.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">There are four playable characters in Super Paper Mario-- <a data-ref-id=\"3005-177\" href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" slug=\"mario\">Mario</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-370\" href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" slug=\"luigi\">Luigi</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-709\" href=\"/peach/3005-709/\" slug=\"peach\">Peach</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-337\" href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\" slug=\"bowser\">Bowser</a>--and each has their own unique abilities. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-370\" href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" slug=\"luigi\">Luigi</a> has a powerful <a data-ref-id=\"3015-20\" href=\"/rocket-jump/3015-20/\" slug=\"rocket-jump\">charged jump</a>; Peach can glide with her parasol and use it as a shield; and Bowser does double damage and breathes fire. Mario's special ability is integral to the game as a whole, as he can rotate the world from 2D to 3D, showing items hidden behind objects, and new paths that would be otherwise invisible.</p><h3>? Blocks</h3><p style=\"\">The ? Blocks in Super Paper Mario are home to more than just the standard fare of a Mario game. Several items are even unique to the game in functionality if not unique in appearance.</p><ul><li><b>Happy Flower:</b> Picking up a Happy Flower makes coins rain from the sky for the next ten seconds.</li><li><b>Mushroom:</b> Restores HP.</li><li><b>Slow Flower/Speed Flower:</b> Blue and red respectively, picking one of these up will either speed everything up or slow everything down for a limited time, including the music. Enemies drop triple coins during this time and killing enemies is worth triple points.</li><li><b>Pal Pills:</b> When the player grabs Mario's 8-bit head from a ? Block, a circle of little 8-bit figures will suddenly appear and follow him around. These Pal Pills will mimic the player's actions and protect from on-comers. They can jump and damage enemies but if they touch a foe, they will die.</li><li><b>Mega Star:</b> The Invincibility Star's awesome cousin. Touching the Mega Star will transform the currently selected into 50-foot tall 8-bit version of themselves that is then free to trample everything in their path for a limited time.</li></ul><h2><b>Pixls</b></h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/212484-sprite2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-212484\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/212484-sprite2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-212484\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2714/212484-sprite2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Thoreau the Pixl</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Pixls are spirits created by the ancients to help make things.

The demo version for Puzzle League is identical to that seen in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-11736\" href=\"/nintendo-puzzle-collection/3030-11736/\">   Nintendo Puzzle Collection</a>, while the demo version for Dr. Mario has <a data-ref-id=\"3045-21\" href=\"/nes/3045-21/\">  NES</a> sound and less animations.<br /><br /><h2>Gameplay   </h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12583/371671-dr_mario_and_puzzle_league_screenshot_014.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-371671\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12583/371671-dr_mario_and_puzzle_league_screenshot_014.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-371671\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12583/371671-dr_mario_and_puzzle_league_screenshot_014.jpg\"></a><figcaption>This version of Puzzle League is different from all previous versions.</figcaption></figure>  Both games included on the cartridge are block-based puzzle games. The version of Dr. Mario is most similar to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1072\" href=\"/dr-mario-64/3030-1072/\"> Dr. Mario 64</a>. As colored pills fall onto the screen, they must be matched with germs of the same color (as well as other pills). Four germs and pills of the same color in a row eliminate those four. Puzzle League is a completely different version from all other versions released. It is most similar to the version that can be downloaded to the GBA with Nintendo Puzzle Collection. In Puzzle League, blocks are constantly approaching the top of the screen. Players must flip blocks to match up three or more in a row.",

The game was released in 1985 for the <a href=\"../../nes/60-21/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Nintendo Entertainment System</a>. Super Mario Bros. has gone on to be considered by many to be one of the best platformers ever created. The <a href=\"http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/gamers/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Guinness World Records Gamer’s Edition</a>, a record keeping organization, declared Super Mario Bros. for the NES as the <a href=\"../../best-selling-games/92-1525/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> best selling</a> video game of all time with more than 40 million copies sold worldwide.</p><p style=\"\">Super Mario Bros. has two direct sequels, numerous spin-offs, and has also crossed mediums--most notably into television and movies. <i>Super Mario Bros.</i>, the movie, was the first <a href=\"../../games-on-which-movies-are-based/92-1019/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> movie to be based on a video game</a>. <a href=\"../../mario/94-177/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Mario</a>, the main character of the game, is one of Nintendo’s most recognizable mascots, and has become so famous that he is recognized worldwide.</p><p style=\"\">The game has been released in a variety of forms. It has been released on the <a href=\"../../game-boy-advance/60-4/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Game Boy Advance</a>, <a href=\"../../snes/93-2795/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, <a href=\"../../nes/93-2794/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, <a href=\"../../virtual-console/92-2925/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Wii Virtual Console</a>, and has been featured in <a href=\"../../animal-crossing/61-12893/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Animal Crossing</a> as a game that can be obtained through use of an <a href=\"/pro-action-replay/3000-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3000-22\"> Action Replay</a>. The game was later repackaged in <a href=\"/super-mario-all-stars/3030-18529/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18529\"> Super Mario All-Stars</a>, along with several other early <a href=\"/super-mario/3025-643/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-643\"> Super Mario</a> games.</p><p style=\"\">The music for the game is composed by <a href=\"../../koji-kondo/72-606/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Koji Kondo</a>, also well known for his compositions in games such as <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3030-11949/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11949\"> The Legend of Zelda</a>. The game's iconic \"Ground Theme\" has been used in dozens of games since, and it is now considered the \"theme song\" of the <a href=\"/mario/3025-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1\"> Mario</a> series. The game's other songs, such as the Starman theme, underwater, underground, the game over jingle, and the castle themes have also been featured in dozens of future games, not limited to the Mario series.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style=\"\"><a href=\"../../the-mushroom-kingdom/95-14/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> The Mushroom Kingdom</a> is invaded by the <a href=\"../../koopa/92-120/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Koopas</a>. The Koopas are a tribe of turtle-like creatures versed in the ways of black magic. Using their black magic abilities they have turned all the Mushroom people into various objects like stones and bricks. Their leader, the evil Koopa King <a href=\"../../bowser/94-337/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Bowser</a>, has kidnapped the only person who can undo the black magic that has trapped the Mushroom people, <a href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-709\"> Princess Toadstool</a>. Mario hears of the plight of the Mushroom people, grabs his brother <a href=\"../../luigi/94-370/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Luigi</a>, and sets out on a quest to free Princess Toadstool.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">The gameplay of Super Mario Bros. is simple. The game has eight worlds, and each world has four sub-levels. Basically, Mario must travel through all eight worlds, avoiding obstacles and enemies along the way. At the end of each world is a castle, in which Mario must fight one of Bowser’s evil minions; with the exception of the last castle in which you fight Bowser himself.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/214732-1177890882_03.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-214732\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/214732-1177890882_03.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-214732\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/775/214732-1177890882_03.png\"></a><figcaption>Mario swims through World 2-2.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">There were also several chances to <a href=\"../../warping/92-852/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Warp</a> ahead and skip levels. World 1-2 had the ability to warp to Worlds 2, 3 or 4, and World 4-2 had the ability to warp worlds 6, 7 and 8. This allowed for the <a href=\"../../speedrun/92-179/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Speedruns</a> to become common.</p><p style=\"\">The weapons in Mario's arsenal are not vast by any means. Mario can <a href=\"../../jump/92-379/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> jump</a> on enemy’s heads, shoot <a href=\"../../fireball/93-120/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> fireballs</a> (by picking up a Fire Flower) at them, or use “Star Power” by picking up a Starman, which makes him an <a href=\"../../temporary-invincibility/92-266/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> invincible machine of destruction</a>, laying waste to everything in his path. Mario can also use the occasional <a href=\"../../koopa-shell/93-309/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Koopa shell</a> to kill enemies. This four pronged offensive is how Mario will dispatch of most enemies, with the exception of Bowser and his castle minions. When it comes to the bosses of the game there is another way of dealing with them that is presented. Jumping on their heads will only get Mario killed, and there are no Starmen to be had during these instances. They can be killed with fireballs, if Mario somehow makes it to the end of the level with with that ability; but if Mario doesn't, there aren't many other approaches to dispatching these enemies.</p><p style=\"\">You begin the game with 3 lives, and you can earn more by obtaining 1-up mushrooms, collecting 100 <a href=\"../../coin/93-219/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> coins</a>, or by jumping on multiple enemies (or a single enemy multiple times) without touching the ground. It is possible to earn many lives very quickly by using exploits such as repeatedly jumping on a Koopa shell, kicking it into a block, and jumping on it again as it returns to you. If you lose all your lives, you are returned to the start screen.</p><p style=\"\">All of the the bosses in the game are standing on bridges over pits of lava, blocking the way to the end of the level. At the end of each bridge is an ax. Using a platform above the boss or running underneath the boss when he jumps, and then touching the ax at the end of the bridge will cause the bridge to collapse, sending the boss into the lava below.</p><p style=\"\">After each one of the “boss” battles a mushroom retainer (aka <a href=\"../../toads/92-3369/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Toads</a>) is saved who says this <a href=\"../../meme-origin/92-2420/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> famous line</a>, “Thank you Mario! But our princess is in another castle!” The exception is, of course, when Mario finally beats Bowser in World 8-4 and rescues <a href=\"../../princess-peach/94-709/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Princess Peach</a>.</p><h2>Characters</h2><ul><li><strong><a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\"> Mario</a> </strong>- Main character of the game.

(and the Nintendo Entertainment System) were released at a major turning point in video game history, shortly after the infamous video game market crash in 1983 (caused by oversaturation of the market with budget, low-quality games). Marketed as more of a toy than a \"video game console,\" the NES was able to find its success due, in part, to Super Mario Bros., which was offered along with a purchase of a new console, rendering it one of the best selling games of all time.</p><p style=\"\">The game popularized the \"side-scrolling platformer\" genre, inspiring clones and lookalikes for several generations following its initial release. Even the NES itself found dozens upon dozens of side-scrolling platformers released for it, indicative of Super Mario Bros.'s effect on game development.</p><p style=\"\">Since its release, Super Mario Bros. has been regarded as one of the most influential games of all time. It is consistently placed on official \"top games of all time\" lists, including lists from publications such as <i>Nintendo Power</i>, <i>Electronic Gaming Monthly</i>, IGN, Screw Attack, <i>Game Informer</i>, and many, many more.</p><h4>Release Date Controversy</h4><p style=\"\">There is minor controversy regarding the actual date of Super Mario Bros.'s release. While the game's official release date in Japan is recorded and well known, its release date in North America is highly disputed, and even the year is uncertain. Several sources cite the release date as 1986, including video game historian Steven Kent.</p><p style=\"\">Official Nintendo sources state the release date is October 18, 1985, which is reciprocated in <a href=\"/super-smash-bros-brawl/3030-20588/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20588\"> Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a>'s \"Chronicle\" section. Supposedly, the game was released coinciding with the release of the NES, however, its original release date is also lost. Other possible release dates include October 12, October 19, and another official Nintendo provided date of November 17, 1985.</p>",

As <a data-ref-id=\"3005-177\" href=\"/mario/3005-177/\">Mario</a> arrives at the centennial Star Festival, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-337\" href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\">Bowser</a> and his armada of airships attack, bringing destruction down upon the kingdom and physically lifting <a data-ref-id=\"3005-709\" href=\"/peach/3005-709/\">Peach's</a> castle into the heavens.

Mario is tasked with restoring power to the observatory, and is promised that once he does this, he'll be given a ride to the center of the universe, where Princess Peach is being held by Bowser. In order to restore power to the observatory, Mario must travel to neighboring galaxies and explore the planets found within to locate power stars. As these power stars are returned, further galaxies and special stages are unlocked, providing some of the most unique and inventive level design in the history of the franchise.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8207/278385-915692_20060914_screen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-278385\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8207/278385-915692_20060914_screen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-278385\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8207/278385-915692_20060914_screen001.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The spin mechanic.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Super Mario Galaxy controls essentially like Super Mario 64, with the addition of a spin mechanic, which is performed by shaking the Wii Remote. Spinning Mario not only produces an effective all-purpose attack, but is also used to activate certain level design features, launch from star catapults, provide a quick boost of speed underwater, and more. The game makes intelligent use of gravity, providing each celestial body in the game with a different gravity field of various strengths, allowing Mario to physically jump from one planet to the next in certain situations. Galaxy also makes the series' first use of a live orchestral soundtrack. Specific elements of gameplay are detailed below.</p><h3>Black Holes</h3><p style=\"\">A new gameplay mechanic, Black Holes force Mario or Luigi's death where it may otherwise seem they would be able to live, particularly when falling into spaces at the center of planetoids and other planet-like platforms and objects. Black Holes also exist in the larger traditional levels so that players who fall of the edge do not fall aimlessly into space for eternity.</p><h3>Coins</h3><p style=\"\">Coins in Super Mario Galaxy take a back seat to Star Bits as the main currency in the game, but do have several uses. Most importantly, coins restore lost health and fill up the air meter when underwater as they did in previous 3D Mario games. Coins no longer earn Stars and are not tracked as a major statistic by the game. Collecting 50 Coins earns a 1-UP. There are also purple coins that, when collected in a certain level, gives you a Power Star. These are missions given by comets and are considered one of the most challenging aspects of the game.</p><h3>Co-Star Mode</h3><p style=\"\">Co-Star Mode allows a second player to cooperatively interact with Star Bits, enemies, and Mario and Luigi in the main single player game. Star Bits can be collected by the second player using the Star Cursor, and then shot at enemies and Mario or Luigi to stun them momentarily. Star Bits will also affect some platform elements in the game, such as rotating yellow tiles and disappearing green tiles that appear in several levels.</p><h3>Ground Pound</h3><p style=\"\">Similar to previous games, Mario and Luigi can use the Ground Pound move to kill or stun most enemies, trigger switches, break blocks, and hasten death when falling a great distance. Performing a Ground Pound while in the middle of a mid-air Spin Attack performs a homing Super Ground Pound on the nearest enemy.</p><h3>Health Meter</h3><p style=\"\">Mario and Luigi's health meter is segmented into three equal parts by default. When the player touches an enemy, lava, fire, or steam, one segment of the health meter is deducted. Standing in freezing water or staying underwater after the air meter is depleted deducts one health segment every few seconds until the players health is depleted entirely. Coins replenish the health meter, one coin for each segment.</p><p style=\"\">There is a power up available in some levels that increase the health meter's segments to a total of six. When this enhanced health meter has been depleted to three remaining segments, the health meter returns to its default state of three segments.</p><h3>Object Grabbing</h3><p style=\"\">Another new move for Mario and Luigi, some objects can be grabbed using the Star Cursor in context-sensitive situations. The Star Cursor can be placed over some objects or enemies which will turn it into a miniature depiction of Mario's gloved-hand, and the player can then press 'A' to grab the object. These objects include Pull Stars, Sling Pods, and the Bomb Boos enemies from the Bouldergeist boss battle in the Ghostly Galaxy.</p><h3>Power-Up Forms</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3186/398421-beemario.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-398421\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3186/398421-beemario.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-398421\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3186/398421-beemario.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Bee Mario</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Bee Mario: With a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-3913\" href=\"/bee-mushroom/3055-3913/\">Bee Mushroom</a>, Mario can fly by holding down the A Button so long as his Flight Meter still has power. Bee Mario can also climb on honeycomb walls and is light enough to walk on clouds, but water will turn him back to normal.</li><li>Boo Mario: A special <a data-ref-id=\"3055-3914\" href=\"/boo-mushroom/3055-3914/\">Boo Mushroom</a> will transform Mario into Boo Mario. Mario can float and hover as a Boo, and by shaking the Wii Remote, he turns invisible, allowing him to pass through certain things in the environment. Light will revert Mario to his normal state.</li><li>Fire Mario: When Mario gets a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-10\" href=\"/fire-flower/3055-10/\">Fire Flower</a>, he will transform into Fire Mario. By shaking the Wii Remote, he shoots fireballs that attack enemies and light torches. The transformation is time-limited, though.</li><li>Ice Mario: Using an <a data-ref-id=\"3055-2947\" href=\"/ice-flower/3055-2947/\">Ice Flower</a>, Mario becomes Ice Mario. As Mario touches water, it becomes a hexagon of ice beneath his feet, allowing him to effectively walk and skate on the water. Like Fire Mario, it is time-limited.</li><li>Spring Mario: With a special <a data-ref-id=\"3055-4814\" href=\"/spring-mushroom/3055-4814/\">Spring Mushroom</a>, Mario is encased in a coil of springs. If A is pressed right as one end of him hits the ground, he will do an incredibly high jump. Spring Mario is also weak to water, and the power-up disappears when he uses a Launch Star.</li><li>Rainbow Mario: After collecting a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-3927\" href=\"/rainbow-star/3055-3927/\">Rainbow Star</a>, Mario's color will change rapidly. He'll become invincible to all damage except the instant-death kind, and can destroy enemies and objects just by touching them. This power-up is very time-limited.</li><li>Flying Mario: After unlocking and collecting the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-3349\" href=\"/red-star/3055-3349/\">Red Star</a>, Mario's color scheme will change, and by jumping into midair and shaking the Remote, he can fly as if he was swimming while holding a turtle shell. This transformation is also time-limited, but does last for a considerable amount of time.</li></ul><h3>Pull Star</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/338753-mariogalaxy_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-338753\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/338753-mariogalaxy_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-338753\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3009/338753-mariogalaxy_001.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Pull Star</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Pull Stars are small objects that appear in some levels and enable Mario and Luigi to navigate through large stretches of open space from one point to another. Placing the Star Cursor directly over them and pressing and holding the 'A' button appropriately pulls the player towards the Pull Star. Additional Pull Stars are usually near by, and can be used in succession to move the player to the nearest platform or landmass.</p><p style=\"\">Moving the Star Cursor too far away from the Pull Star while hold 'A' or letting go of the 'A' button will allow the player to drop back to the nearest gravity source or will drop them into the black hole below to their death if no gravity source is nearby.</p><h3>Sling Star</h3><p style=\"\">Comparable to an un-aimable cannon, Sling Stars shoot Mario and Luigi varying distances throughout a level, most often used to move from the many small planetoids than make up the non-traditional levels. Sling Stars are enabled by jumping into the middle of them, and then performing a Spin Attack maneuver.</p><h3>Sling Pod</h3><p style=\"\">Sling Pods are large, sticky, elastic grey hands located primarily in the Sling Pod galaxy. They work like a sling shot and are used via Mario and Luigi's context sensitive grab mechanic to aim and shoot the player from one point to another.</p><h3>Spin Attack</h3><p style=\"\">New to Mario 3D platformers, the spin attack adds several significant gameplay strategies. Through a quick lateral flick of the Wii Remote, players can stun enemies and send them spinning (running into, jumping onto, or ground stomping on them then kills), activate Sling Stars, pull-in nearby coins and Star Bits, and extend jumps mid-air to collect coins from dangerous or high places, and save ones-self from falling undesirably.</p><h3>Stars</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/100719/1431742-green_power_star.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1431742\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/100719/1431742-green_power_star.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1431742\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/100719/1431742-green_power_star.jpg\"></a><figcaption>One of the Power Stars in the game, a green one.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">There are a total of 121 unique Stars that are earned by completing objectives within each galaxy. Most objectives are met by reaching a goal point set at the end of an obstacle ridden-path or by collecting 100 Purple Coins. Unlike Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine, collecting 100 Coins is not rewarded with a Star.</p><p style=\"\">Collecting 120 Stars with Mario unlocks Luigi as a second playable character. Collecting 120 stars with Luigi unlocks the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2321\" href=\"/grand-finale-galaxy/3035-2321/\">Grand Finale Galaxy</a> on the Planet of Trials, which contains the 121st star. This final star can be collected by both Mario and Luigi, making the total number of possible stars on a game save 242. A picture and congratulatory note is sent as reward to the player's Wii Message Board after collecting the 121st star. While the note is the same, collecting the star with Mario and Luigi earns unique pictures.</p><h3>Star Bits</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/389/210059-mariostarbits.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-210059\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/389/210059-mariostarbits.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-210059\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/389/210059-mariostarbits.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Star Bits</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Star Bits are the main currency of Super Mario Galaxy. Mario and Luigi can collect Star Bits by running over them as item collecting is done in most traditional platformers, or by using the Star Cursor to pick up Star Bits that are visible anywhere on the screen regardless of Mario or Luigi's proximity to them.</p><p style=\"\">Collecting 9999 Star Bits turns all of the coconuts in the game into watermelons. Collecting 50 Star Bits earns a 1-UP.</p><h3>Star Cursor</h3><p style=\"\">Throughout the game, the Wii Remote can be used as a pointing device with several purposes; collecting Star Bits, aiming to shoot Star Bits, grabbing Pull Stars, and grabbing certain enemies. Moving the Star Cursor over enemies also plays musical notes that change pitch in sync with the game's music.</p><h3>Story Completion</h3><p style=\"\">The story in Super Mario Galaxy can be completed once 60 Power Stars have been collected (or up to 121, if you like). Speaking to Rosalina after collecting the 60th Star (in any order you like) opens up the final Bowser level \"at the center of the Universe\" (or in this case, Bowser's Galaxy Reactor). After completing the final fight with Bowser and when you get the 7th and final Grand Star, the ending cinema and credits play, and then the player is prompted to save their game and can load this save to continue collecting the remaining Stars.</p><h3>Secret Ending</h3><p style=\"\">If all 120 Stars are collected as Mario, then after the credits, you'll see a special ending starring Rosalina telling the player thanks for all the hard work that you've done in the game and you'll be able to play as Luigi after you save your game. Then if 120 of them are collected as Luigi, then you'll see the same thing but this time after you save, Mario and Luigi can get the 121st and final Star.</p><h2>Characters</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/389/335983-smg_yellowluma.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-335983\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/389/335983-smg_yellowluma.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-335983\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/389/335983-smg_yellowluma.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Luma</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Bees</li><li>Board, Bill</li><li>Board, Gill</li><li>Board, Phil</li><li>Board, Jill</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-337\" href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\">Bowser</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-825\" href=\"/bowser-jr/3005-825/\">Bowser Jr.</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-11665\" href=\"/coach/3005-11665/\">Coach</a></li><li>Cosmic Mario</li><li>Cosmic Luigi</li><li>Gearmo</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-13471\" href=\"/guppy/3005-13471/\">Guppy</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-12892\" href=\"/luma/3005-12892/\">Luma</a></li><li>Penguin</li><li>Penguru</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-709\" href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709/\">Princess Peach</a></li><li>Queen Bee</li><li>Rabbit</li><li>Ray</li><li>Spooky Speedster</li><li>Toad Brigade</li></ul><h2>Enemies</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/942903-boo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-942903\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/942903-boo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-942903\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/942903-boo.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Boo</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Banzai Bills</li><li>Bloopers</li><li>Bob-ombs</li><li>Bomb Boos</li><li>Bomb Chickens</li><li>Boos</li><li>Boulders</li><li>Brrr Bits</li><li>Bullet Bills</li><li>Burn Bits</li><li>Cataquacks</li><li>Cheep-Cheeps</li><li>Chomp Heads</li><li>Cosmic Scuttle Bugs</li><li>Crabs</li><li>Dry Bones</li><li>Electrogoombas</li><li>Fire Shooters</li><li>Firebars</li><li>Goombas</li><li>Grand Goombas</li><li>Gringills</li><li>Jellyfish</li><li>Koopas</li><li>Magikoopas</li><li>Mandibugs</li><li>Mecha-Koopas</li><li>Piranha Plants</li><li>Podoboos</li><li>Pokey Sprouts</li><li>Pokeys</li><li>Pumpkin Heads</li><li>Pushy Walls</li><li>Rocky Wrenches</li><li>Swoopers</li><li>Swoopin' Poinks</li><li>Thwomps</li><li>Topman</li><li>Torpedo Teds</li><li>Tox Boxes</li><li>Tweesters</li><li>Urchins</li><li>Water Shooters</li><li>Wigglers</li></ul><h2>Bosses</h2><p style=\"\">There are sixteen unique bosses in Super Mario Galaxy.

Yokota used Latin instruments and a synthesizer to create a sci-fi sound for the Super Mario Galaxy theme and was approved by the game's designer, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-38701\" href=\"/yoshiaki-koizumi/3040-38701/\">Yoshiaki Koizumi</a>, but when presented to <a data-ref-id=\"3040-606\" href=\"/koji-kondo/3040-606/\">Koji Kondo</a>, he said the song was no good. Three months later, Yokota produced three different styles of music for the game and presented them to <a data-ref-id=\"3040-614\" href=\"/shigeru-miyamoto/3040-614/\">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>. One piece had an orchestral sound, the second was a mix of orchestral sound and pop music and the final was pop music. <a data-ref-id=\"3040-614\" href=\"/shigeru-miyamoto/3040-614/\">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> chose the orchestral piece which <a data-ref-id=\"3040-606\" href=\"/koji-kondo/3040-606/\">Koji Kondo</a> wrote. From then on, it was decided that Super Mario Galaxy's soundtrack would be composed for a symphony which is performed by the Mario Galaxy Orchestra.</p><p style=\"\">Some of the stages incorporated brand new scores specially for the game while older themes were implemented in other stages.</p><p style=\"\">A soundtrack to the game was released on January 24 2008 in Japan and was an exclusive to Club Nintendo subscribers only. Two versions were produced. A standard version which included one disc holding 67 minutes of music from the game and a Platinum Edition which had two discs, the first disc containing the same music from the standard version in addition to a second disc which added an extra 62 minutes of music from the game.

As of April 2012, the game sold 10.68 million copies worldwide.</p><p style=\"\">Super Mario Galaxy is one of the highest rated games of all time, becoming the first game to top The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, albeit temporarily, on GameRankings.com. Critics stated that the game had beautiful graphics, fluid animation work, simplified and responsive gameplay and controls, innovative level designs, an orchestral soundtrack, and a steady difficulty curve, as well as universal appeal. Reggie Fils-Amis hailed \"Galaxy\" as the \"first worthy successor to 'Mario 64'\"; IGN.com concurred with this claim, while G4TV argued that Super Mario Galaxy is in fact the superior game. Play Magazine exalted \"Galaxy\" as the most profound installment since the original \"Super Mario Bros.,\" and PALGN stated that \"Galaxy\" is the finest game Nintendo have produced this decade.</p><p style=\"\">Common criticisms include its easy difficulty during the first half of the game. GameShark.com argued that the creativity and brilliance of the opening salvos fails to be retained in the latter half, while Ben \"Yahtzee\" Crowshaw of \"Zero Punctuation\" retorted that \"Galaxy's\" attempts at being unique, via its gravity effects and circular landscapes, interferes with the core gameplay, and that the Wii Remote does not contribute to an overall better control scheme over a GameCube controller.</p><p style=\"\">Galaxy won several Game of the Year awards, from publications such as Gamespot, IGN, Gametrailers and Nintendo Power, and was also nominated for <a href=\"/features/best-of-2008/1/?category=6\">Giant Bomb's '2008's 2007 Game Of The Year'</a>, as well as the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences award for Game of the Year.</p><h2>Other Info</h2><p style=\"\">1-2 players</p><p style=\"\">Nunchuk required</p><p style=\"\">Dolby Pro Logic II</p>",

As usual, Dr. Mario is about to begin his research when Nurse Toadstool informs him that several viruses are out of control and spreading quickly. Mario exclaims <i>\"Oh No!

These vitamins are colored one of three colors on each side (red, yellow, or blue). The colored vitamin must be matched with the corresponding virus the same color, and after stacking up four of the same color, the virus is eliminated.

It takes an even greater influence from the Gameboy game titled Donkey Kong. The levels have the classic construction site level designs. The levels have player using platforming skills, but the levels are essentially puzzles. Mario will have to retrieve a key somewhere in a level, and the key opens up a door in the level. The player will have to think and skilfully use platform his or her way through a level. Puzzle elements enter the game also in levels where Mario collects mini marios. The mini marios will have to be led through a level, and be put into a toybox. After you collect mini marios you enter a boss stage where you face Donkey Kong with the mini's help. Depending on how many you rescued they will act as a health bar for Mario during these boss encounters. Each boss features Donkey Kong in which you generally throw barrels or objects at him. As you progress through the game many bonus levels will eventually be opened.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12541/393116-mario_vs._donkey_kong_57.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-393116\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12541/393116-mario_vs._donkey_kong_57.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-393116\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12541/393116-mario_vs._donkey_kong_57.png\"></a><figcaption>First the key then the door</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Once you've beaten the 6 worlds and defeated Donkey Kong the player can enter plus mode where you play 6 new worlds (but with the same themes). In plus mode (or plus worlds) the game plays a little different, the key is now attached to a mini Mario who Mario must guide through the enemies and traps. The level is completed once Mario and his Toy clone are both standing before the goal door. Also unlike normal mode, plus mode only has one area each level. Once the player completes all six plus worlds you face of DK in the true final battle.</p><p style=\"\">The worlds in this game are:</p><ol><li>Mario Toy Company</li><li>Donkey Kong Jungle</li><li>Fire Mountain</li><li>Spooky House</li><li>Mystic Forest</li><li>Twilight City</li></ol>",

All three games were included on a single cartridge, and the game was       packaged with two NES controllers, a  Zapper (for use with Duck Hunt), and a Power Pad (for use with World Class Track Meet). The three games are all the same as their single-cartridge form; the only difference is the fact that they are on a single cartridge.<br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Super Mario Bros.  </h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1473/474578-virtuanes_2008_07_31_20_20_55_50.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-474578\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1473/474578-virtuanes_2008_07_31_20_20_55_50.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-474578\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1473/474578-virtuanes_2008_07_31_20_20_55_50.jpg\"></a><figcaption> The Super Mario Bros. Title Screen</figcaption></figure> <br/>Super Mario Bros. is the first game in the  Mario franchise. It is a platforming game starring <a data-ref-id=\"3005-177\" href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" slug=\"mario\">  Mario</a> on his quest to rescue <a data-ref-id=\"3005-709\" href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709/\" slug=\"princess-peach\">  Princess Peach</a> from the clutches of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-337\" href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\" slug=\"bowser\">  Bowser</a>. The game is a traditional 2D side-scrolling platformer. Players control Mario as they guide him to the end of each level. Every world has eight levels, many of which contain secret shortcuts that can even assist the player in skipping large portions of the game. Every level has coins and items to gather, both aiding Mario in his quest. Gathering enough coins gives Mario an extra life, while power-ups (<a data-ref-id=\"3055-49\" href=\"/super-mushroom/3055-49/\" slug=\"super-mushroom\">  Super Mushroom</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-10\" href=\"/fire-flower/3055-10/\" slug=\"fire-flower\">  Fire Flower</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-23\" href=\"/starman/3055-23/\" slug=\"starman\">  Starman</a>) can give Mario new abilities. The Super Mushroom allows Mario to grow in size, the Fire Flower gives Mario the ability to throw fireballs, and the Starman gives Mario temporary invincibility.<br/><br/><h3>Duck Hunt</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511386-duckhunt_1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-511386\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511386-duckhunt_1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-511386\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5312/511386-duckhunt_1.png\"></a><figcaption>The title screen of Duck Hunt.</figcaption></figure><br/>Duck Hunt uses the Zapper, a light-gun peripheral for the NES. There are three modes in Duck Hunt: two of which involve different variations of ducks (one or two ducks), and a clay shooting mode. In the clay pigeon shooting mode, the player must be quicker and more accurate (as the clay pigeons are smaller and come out quicker). Throughout Duck Hunt, the player is accompanied by a dog, who has become quite infamous. The dog laughs at the player upon missing, and (to many players' dismay) cannot be shot.<br/><br/><h3>World Class Track Meet</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5822/562483-world_class_track_meet_screen_4.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-562483\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5822/562483-world_class_track_meet_screen_4.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-562483\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5822/562483-world_class_track_meet_screen_4.png\"></a><figcaption>The title screen of World Class Track Meet.</figcaption></figure><br/>World Class Track Meet uses the Power Pad, an NES peripheral which is a gray mat with large buttons that can be pressed by standing on them (so running can be simulated). World Class Track Meet has a variety of events to compete in, all of which can use the Power Pad's unique abilities. World Class Track Meet is the result of <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" slug=\"nintendo\">  Nintendo</a> buying <a data-ref-id=\"3010-272\" href=\"/bandai-co-ltd/3010-272/\" slug=\"bandai-co-ltd\">  Bandai</a>'s Stadium Events game, and then converting it into a game for North American audiences (the game was a part of Bandai's  Family Trainer series, which was mostly Japan-only).",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Dr. Mario is back in this new <a data-ref-id=\"3045-87\" href=\"/wii-shop/3045-87/\" slug=\"wii-shop\">WiiWare</a> titles which hit the WiiWare store on May 26, 2008 for 1000 Nintendo Points. When it released it became an instant classic, using the same simple game mechanics as the previous versions of the series, line up the two sided pills to wipe out the viruses on screen, only this time you can use your Mii as your character. This is the first Dr. Mario to include online play and even includes a way to send a demo to a friend on WiiWare to play against with only one version of the game.</p><h2>Game Modes</h2><p style=\"\">There are two game modes in Dr. Mario RX:</p><h3>Classic Dr. Mario</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12840/305424-drmorx.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-305424\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12840/305424-drmorx.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-305424\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12840/305424-drmorx.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Dr. Mario Online RX Screen</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">This version is just classic Dr. Mario, lining up the pills and viruses with the D-pad, trying to avoid letting the pills build up. The way this mode stands our is with it's online modes. You can choose either regular or flash mode, in flash mode you only need to line up the blinking viruses to add a bit more strategy to the game. There are random matches with rankings which start at 5000 and fluctuate depending on your wins or losses, and you can also send a demo to a friend to play head to head against each other with one game copy. Unfortunately the online is only two-players, which is surprising as four-players have been used in past Dr. Mario games. All in all however, this is a quality online mode and is great fun if you're a fan of Dr. Mario.</p><h3>Virus Buster</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12840/305412-dr_mario_online_rx_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-305412\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12840/305412-dr_mario_online_rx_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-305412\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12840/305412-dr_mario_online_rx_03.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Dr. Mario Online RX Screen 2</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Virus Buster Mode is an all new mode to Dr. Mario, taking the Wii Mote concept and applying it to falling pills, allowing to control the pills movement speed and direction with your motions instead of the D-pad. Another difference to the mode is that multiple pills can fall at once from the top which almost requires you to have another player beside you, there is no online co-op for this mode, but there is local co-op, which seems to be a dying breed in today's games. You cannot move the pill upwards, but you are free to move it in any other direction. In this mode you can have any Mii on your system walking by on the screen against a group of viruses, as you clear the board the viruses fall, and your Miis are left standing and dance when you completely clear the board.</p><p style=\"\">All in all this is classic Dr. Mario with a few modern spins to make it feel more like a Wii game.</p>",
